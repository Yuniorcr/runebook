          <source>The Accept request-header field can be used to specify certain media
   types which are acceptable for the response. Accept headers can be
   used to indicate that the request is specifically limited to a small
   set of desired types, as in the case of a request for an in-line
   image.

       Accept         = &quot;Accept&quot; &quot;:&quot;
                        #( media-range [ accept-params ] )

       media-range    = ( &quot;*/*&quot;
                        | ( type &quot;/&quot; &quot;*&quot; )
                        | ( type &quot;/&quot; subtype )
                        ) *( &quot;;&quot; parameter )
       accept-params  = &quot;;&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;=&quot; qvalue *( accept-extension )
       accept-extension = &quot;;&quot; token [ &quot;=&quot; ( token | quoted-string ) ]

   The asterisk &quot;*&quot; character is used to group media types into ranges,
   with &quot;*/*&quot; indicating all media types and &quot;type/*&quot; indicating all
   subtypes of that type. The media-range MAY include media type
   parameters that are applicable to that range.

   Each media-range MAY be followed by one or more accept-params,
   beginning with the &quot;q&quot; parameter for indicating a relative quality
   factor. The first &quot;q&quot; parameter (if any) separates the media-range
   parameter(s) from the accept-params. Quality factors allow the user
   or user agent to indicate the relative degree of preference for that
   media-range, using the qvalue scale from 0 to 1 (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.9&quot;&gt;section 3.9&lt;/a&gt;). The
   default value is q=1.

      Note: Use of the &quot;q&quot; parameter name to separate media type
      parameters from Accept extension parameters is due to historical
      practice. Although this prevents any media type parameter named
      &quot;q&quot; from being used with a media range, such an event is believed
      to be unlikely given the lack of any &quot;q&quot; parameters in the IANA
      media type registry and the rare usage of any media type
      parameters in Accept. Future media types are discouraged from
      registering any parameter named &quot;q&quot;. 

   The example

       Accept: audio/*; q=0.2, audio/basic

   SHOULD be interpreted as &quot;I prefer audio/basic, but send me any audio
   type if it is the best available after an 80% mark-down in quality.&quot;

   If no Accept header field is present, then it is assumed that the
   client accepts all media types. If an Accept header field is present,
   and if the server cannot send a response which is acceptable
   according to the combined Accept field value, then the server SHOULD
   send a 406 (not acceptable) response.

   A more elaborate example is

       Accept: text/plain; q=0.5, text/html,
               text/x-dvi; q=0.8, text/x-c

   Verbally, this would be interpreted as &quot;text/html and text/x-c are
   the preferred media types, but if they do not exist, then send the
   text/x-dvi entity, and if that does not exist, send the text/plain
   entity.&quot;

   Media ranges can be overridden by more specific media ranges or
   specific media types. If more than one media range applies to a given
   type, the most specific reference has precedence. For example,

       Accept: text/*, text/html, text/html;level=1, */*

   have the following precedence:

       1) text/html;level=1
       2) text/html
       3) text/*
       4) */*

   The media type quality factor associated with a given type is
   determined by finding the media range with the highest precedence
   which matches that type. For example,

       Accept: text/*;q=0.3, text/html;q=0.7, text/html;level=1,
               text/html;level=2;q=0.4, */*;q=0.5

   would cause the following values to be associated:

       text/html;level=1         = 1
       text/html                 = 0.7
       text/plain                = 0.3 

       image/jpeg                = 0.5
       text/html;level=2         = 0.4
       text/html;level=3         = 0.7

      Note: A user agent might be provided with a default set of quality
      values for certain media ranges. However, unless the user agent is
      a closed system which cannot interact with other rendering agents,
      this default set ought to be configurable by the user.</source>

          <source>The Accept-Charset request-header field can be used to indicate what
   character sets are acceptable for the response. This field allows
   clients capable of understanding more comprehensive or special-
   purpose character sets to signal that capability to a server which is
   capable of representing documents in those character sets.

      Accept-Charset = &quot;Accept-Charset&quot; &quot;:&quot;
              1#( ( charset | &quot;*&quot; )[ &quot;;&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;=&quot; qvalue ] )


   Character set values are described in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.4&quot;&gt;section 3.4&lt;/a&gt;. Each charset MAY
   be given an associated quality value which represents the user's
   preference for that charset. The default value is q=1. An example is

      Accept-Charset: iso-8859-5, unicode-1-1;q=0.8

   The special value &quot;*&quot;, if present in the Accept-Charset field,
   matches every character set (including ISO-8859-1) which is not
   mentioned elsewhere in the Accept-Charset field. If no &quot;*&quot; is present
   in an Accept-Charset field, then all character sets not explicitly
   mentioned get a quality value of 0, except for ISO-8859-1, which gets
   a quality value of 1 if not explicitly mentioned.

   If no Accept-Charset header is present, the default is that any
   character set is acceptable. If an Accept-Charset header is present,
   and if the server cannot send a response which is acceptable
   according to the Accept-Charset header, then the server SHOULD send
   an error response with the 406 (not acceptable) status code, though
   the sending of an unacceptable response is also allowed.</source>

          <source>The Accept-Encoding request-header field is similar to Accept, but
   restricts the content-codings (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.5&quot;&gt;section 3.5&lt;/a&gt;) that are acceptable in
   the response.

       Accept-Encoding  = &quot;Accept-Encoding&quot; &quot;:&quot; 

                          1#( codings [ &quot;;&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;=&quot; qvalue ] )
       codings          = ( content-coding | &quot;*&quot; )

   Examples of its use are:

       Accept-Encoding: compress, gzip
       Accept-Encoding:
       Accept-Encoding: *
       Accept-Encoding: compress;q=0.5, gzip;q=1.0
       Accept-Encoding: gzip;q=1.0, identity; q=0.5, *;q=0

   A server tests whether a content-coding is acceptable, according to
   an Accept-Encoding field, using these rules:

      1. If the content-coding is one of the content-codings listed in
         the Accept-Encoding field, then it is acceptable, unless it is
         accompanied by a qvalue of 0. (As defined in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.9&quot;&gt;section 3.9&lt;/a&gt;, a
         qvalue of 0 means &quot;not acceptable.&quot;)

      2. The special &quot;*&quot; symbol in an Accept-Encoding field matches any
         available content-coding not explicitly listed in the header
         field.

      3. If multiple content-codings are acceptable, then the acceptable
         content-coding with the highest non-zero qvalue is preferred.

      4. The &quot;identity&quot; content-coding is always acceptable, unless
         specifically refused because the Accept-Encoding field includes
         &quot;identity;q=0&quot;, or because the field includes &quot;*;q=0&quot; and does
         not explicitly include the &quot;identity&quot; content-coding. If the
         Accept-Encoding field-value is empty, then only the &quot;identity&quot;
         encoding is acceptable.

   If an Accept-Encoding field is present in a request, and if the
   server cannot send a response which is acceptable according to the
   Accept-Encoding header, then the server SHOULD send an error response
   with the 406 (Not Acceptable) status code.

   If no Accept-Encoding field is present in a request, the server MAY
   assume that the client will accept any content coding. In this case,
   if &quot;identity&quot; is one of the available content-codings, then the
   server SHOULD use the &quot;identity&quot; content-coding, unless it has
   additional information that a different content-coding is meaningful
   to the client.

      Note: If the request does not include an Accept-Encoding field,
      and if the &quot;identity&quot; content-coding is unavailable, then
      content-codings commonly understood by HTTP/1.0 clients (i.e., 

      &quot;gzip&quot; and &quot;compress&quot;) are preferred; some older clients
      improperly display messages sent with other content-codings.  The
      server might also make this decision based on information about
      the particular user-agent or client.

      Note: Most HTTP/1.0 applications do not recognize or obey qvalues
      associated with content-codings. This means that qvalues will not
      work and are not permitted with x-gzip or x-compress.</source>

          <source>The Accept-Language request-header field is similar to Accept, but
   restricts the set of natural languages that are preferred as a
   response to the request. Language tags are defined in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.10&quot;&gt;section 3.10&lt;/a&gt;.

       Accept-Language = &quot;Accept-Language&quot; &quot;:&quot;
                         1#( language-range [ &quot;;&quot; &quot;q&quot; &quot;=&quot; qvalue ] )
       language-range  = ( ( 1*8ALPHA *( &quot;-&quot; 1*8ALPHA ) ) | &quot;*&quot; )

   Each language-range MAY be given an associated quality value which
   represents an estimate of the user's preference for the languages
   specified by that range. The quality value defaults to &quot;q=1&quot;. For
   example,

       Accept-Language: da, en-gb;q=0.8, en;q=0.7

   would mean: &quot;I prefer Danish, but will accept British English and
   other types of English.&quot; A language-range matches a language-tag if
   it exactly equals the tag, or if it exactly equals a prefix of the
   tag such that the first tag character following the prefix is &quot;-&quot;.
   The special range &quot;*&quot;, if present in the Accept-Language field,
   matches every tag not matched by any other range present in the
   Accept-Language field.

      Note: This use of a prefix matching rule does not imply that
      language tags are assigned to languages in such a way that it is
      always true that if a user understands a language with a certain
      tag, then this user will also understand all languages with tags
      for which this tag is a prefix. The prefix rule simply allows the
      use of prefix tags if this is the case.

   The language quality factor assigned to a language-tag by the
   Accept-Language field is the quality value of the longest language-
   range in the field that matches the language-tag. If no language-
   range in the field matches the tag, the language quality factor
   assigned is 0. If no Accept-Language header is present in the
   request, the server 

   SHOULD assume that all languages are equally acceptable. If an
   Accept-Language header is present, then all languages which are
   assigned a quality factor greater than 0 are acceptable.

   It might be contrary to the privacy expectations of the user to send
   an Accept-Language header with the complete linguistic preferences of
   the user in every request. For a discussion of this issue, see
   &lt;a href=&quot;#section-15.1.4&quot;&gt;section 15.1.4&lt;/a&gt;.

   As intelligibility is highly dependent on the individual user, it is
   recommended that client applications make the choice of linguistic
   preference available to the user. If the choice is not made
   available, then the Accept-Language header field MUST NOT be given in
   the request.

      Note: When making the choice of linguistic preference available to
      the user, we remind implementors of  the fact that users are not
      familiar with the details of language matching as described above,
      and should provide appropriate guidance. As an example, users
      might assume that on selecting &quot;en-gb&quot;, they will be served any
      kind of English document if British English is not available. A
      user agent might suggest in such a case to add &quot;en&quot; to get the
      best matching behavior.</source>

          <source>The Age header field is used to convey an estimated age of the
   response message when obtained from a cache.  The Age field value is
   the cache's estimate of the number of seconds since the response was
   generated or validated by the origin server.  In essence, the Age 

   value is the sum of the time that the response has been resident in
   each of the caches along the path from the origin server, plus the
   amount of time it has been in transit along network paths.

   The following data is used for the age calculation:

   age_value

      The term &quot;age_value&quot; denotes the value of the Age header field
      (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-5.1&quot;&gt;Section 5.1&lt;/a&gt;), in a form appropriate for arithmetic operation; or
      0, if not available.

   date_value

      The term &quot;date_value&quot; denotes the value of the Date header field,
      in a form appropriate for arithmetic operations.  See &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.2&quot;&gt;Section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.1.2&quot;&gt;7.1.1.2 of [RFC7231]&lt;/a&gt; for the definition of the Date header field,
      and for requirements regarding responses without it.

   now

      The term &quot;now&quot; means &quot;the current value of the clock at the host
      performing the calculation&quot;.  A host ought to use NTP ([&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5905&quot;&gt;RFC5905&lt;/a&gt;])
      or some similar protocol to synchronize its clocks to Coordinated
      Universal Time.

   request_time

      The current value of the clock at the host at the time the request
      resulting in the stored response was made.

   response_time

      The current value of the clock at the host at the time the
      response was received.

   A response's age can be calculated in two entirely independent ways:

   1.  the &quot;apparent_age&quot;: response_time minus date_value, if the local
       clock is reasonably well synchronized to the origin server's
       clock.  If the result is negative, the result is replaced by
       zero.

   2.  the &quot;corrected_age_value&quot;, if all of the caches along the
       response path implement HTTP/1.1.  A cache MUST interpret this
       value relative to the time the request was initiated, not the
       time that the response was received. 

     apparent_age = max(0, response_time - date_value);

     response_delay = response_time - request_time;
     corrected_age_value = age_value + response_delay;

   These are combined as

     corrected_initial_age = max(apparent_age, corrected_age_value);

   unless the cache is confident in the value of the Age header field
   (e.g., because there are no HTTP/1.0 hops in the Via header field),
   in which case the corrected_age_value MAY be used as the
   corrected_initial_age.

   The current_age of a stored response can then be calculated by adding
   the amount of time (in seconds) since the stored response was last
   validated by the origin server to the corrected_initial_age.

     resident_time = now - response_time;
     current_age = corrected_initial_age + resident_time;</source>

          Allow   = &quot;Allow&quot; &quot;:&quot; #Method

      Example of use:

          Allow: GET, HEAD, PUT

      This field cannot prevent a client from trying other methods.
      However, the indications given by the Allow header field value
      SHOULD be followed. The actual set of allowed methods is defined
      by the origin server at the time of each request.

      The Allow header field MAY be provided with a PUT request to
      recommend the methods to be supported by the new or modified
      resource. The server is not required to support these methods and
      SHOULD include an Allow header in the response giving the actual
      supported methods. 

      A proxy MUST NOT modify the Allow header field even if it does not
      understand all the methods specified, since the user agent might
      have other means of communicating with the origin server.</source>

          <source>The Atom Protocol imposes few restrictions on the actions of servers.
   Unless a constraint is specified here, servers can be expected to
   vary in behavior, in particular around the manipulation of Atom
   Entries sent by clients.  For example, although this specification
   only defines the expected behavior of Collections with respect to GET
   and POST, this does not imply that PUT, DELETE, PROPPATCH, and others
   are forbidden on Collection Resources -- only that this specification
   does not define what the server's response would be to those methods.
   Similarly, while some HTTP status codes are mentioned explicitly,
   clients ought to be prepared to handle any status code from a server.
   Servers can choose to accept, reject, delay, moderate, censor,
   reformat, translate, relocate, or re-categorize the content submitted
   to them.  Only some of these choices are immediately relayed back to
   the client in responses to client requests; other choices may only
   become apparent later, in the feed or published entries.  The same
   series of requests to two different publishing sites can result in a
   different series of HTTP responses, different resulting feeds, or
   different entry contents.

   As a result, client software has to be written flexibly to accept
   what the server decides are the results of its submissions.  Any
   server response or server content modification not explicitly
   forbidden by this specification or HTTP [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616&quot;&gt;RFC2616&lt;/a&gt;] is therefore

      in part.

   o  Services: Discovery and description of Collections.

   The Atom Publishing Protocol is different from many contemporary

   The threats listed in this section apply to many protocols that run
   under HTTP.  The Atompub Working Group decided that the protection
   afforded by running authenticated HTTP under TLS (as described in

          <source>The Atom Publishing Protocol is based on HTTP.  Authentication
   requirements for HTTP are covered in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-11&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;11 of [RFC2616]&lt;/a&gt;.

   The use of authentication mechanisms to prevent POSTing or editing by
   unknown or unauthorized clients is RECOMMENDED but not required.
   When authentication is not used, clients and servers are vulnerable
   to trivial spoofing, denial-of-service, and defacement attacks.
   However, in some contexts, this is an acceptable risk.

   The type of authentication deployed is a local decision made by the
   server operator.  Clients are likely to face authentication schemes
   that vary across server deployments.  At a minimum, client and server
   implementations MUST be capable of being configured to use HTTP Basic
   Authentication [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617&quot;&gt;RFC2617&lt;/a&gt;] in conjunction with a connection made with
   TLS 1.0 [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2246&quot;&gt;RFC2246&lt;/a&gt;] or a subsequent standards-track version of TLS
   (such as [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4346&quot;&gt;RFC4346&lt;/a&gt;]), supporting the conventions for using HTTP over
   TLS described in [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818&quot;&gt;RFC2818&lt;/a&gt;]. 

   The choice of authentication mechanism will impact interoperability.
   The minimum level of security referenced above (Basic Authentication
   with TLS) is considered good practice for Internet applications at
   the time of publication of this specification and sufficient for
   establishing a baseline for interoperability.  Implementers are
   encouraged to investigate and use alternative mechanisms regarded as
   equivalently good or better at the time of deployment.  It is
   RECOMMENDED that clients be implemented in such a way that new
   authentication schemes can be deployed.

   Because this protocol uses HTTP response status codes as the primary
   means of reporting the result of a request, servers are advised to
   respond to unauthorized or unauthenticated requests using an
   appropriate 4xx HTTP response code (e.g., 401 &quot;Unauthorized&quot; or 403
   &quot;Forbidden&quot;) in accordance with [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617&quot;&gt;RFC2617&lt;/a&gt;].</source>

          <source>The Atom Publishing Protocol uses HTTP methods to author Member
   Resources as follows:

   o  GET is used to retrieve a representation of a known Resource.

   o  POST is used to create a new, dynamically named, Resource.  When
      the client submits non-Atom-Entry representations to a Collection
      for creation, two Resources are always created -- a Media Entry
      for the requested Resource, and a Media Link Entry for metadata
      about the Resource that will appear in the Collection.

   o  PUT is used to edit a known Resource.  It is not used for Resource
      creation.

   o  DELETE is used to remove a known Resource.

   The Atom Protocol only covers the creating, editing, and deleting of
   Entry and Media Resources.  Other Resources could be created, edited,
   and deleted as the result of manipulating a Collection, but the
   number of those Resources, their media types, and effects of Atom
   Protocol operations on them are outside the scope of this

          <source>The CONNECT method requests that the recipient establish a tunnel to
   the destination origin server identified by the request-target and,
   if successful, thereafter restrict its behavior to blind forwarding
   of packets, in both directions, until the tunnel is closed.  Tunnels
   are commonly used to create an end-to-end virtual connection, through
   one or more proxies, which can then be secured using TLS (Transport
   Layer Security, [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246&quot;&gt;RFC5246&lt;/a&gt;]).

   CONNECT is intended only for use in requests to a proxy.  An origin
   server that receives a CONNECT request for itself MAY respond with a
   2xx (Successful) status code to indicate that a connection is
   established.  However, most origin servers do not implement CONNECT.

   A client sending a CONNECT request MUST send the authority form of
   request-target (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.3&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;5.3 of [RFC7230]&lt;/a&gt;); i.e., the request-target
   consists of only the host name and port number of the tunnel
   destination, separated by a colon.  For example,

     CONNECT server.example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com:80

   The recipient proxy can establish a tunnel either by directly
   connecting to the request-target or, if configured to use another
   proxy, by forwarding the CONNECT request to the next inbound proxy.
   Any 2xx (Successful) response indicates that the sender (and all 

   inbound proxies) will switch to tunnel mode immediately after the
   blank line that concludes the successful response's header section;
   data received after that blank line is from the server identified by
   the request-target.  Any response other than a successful response
   indicates that the tunnel has not yet been formed and that the
   connection remains governed by HTTP.

   A tunnel is closed when a tunnel intermediary detects that either
   side has closed its connection: the intermediary MUST attempt to send
   any outstanding data that came from the closed side to the other
   side, close both connections, and then discard any remaining data
   left undelivered.

   Proxy authentication might be used to establish the authority to
   create a tunnel.  For example,

     CONNECT server.example.com:80 HTTP/1.1
     Host: server.example.com:80
     Proxy-Authorization: basic aGVsbG86d29ybGQ=

   There are significant risks in establishing a tunnel to arbitrary
   servers, particularly when the destination is a well-known or
   reserved TCP port that is not intended for Web traffic.  For example,
   a CONNECT to a request-target of &quot;example.com:25&quot; would suggest that
   the proxy connect to the reserved port for SMTP traffic; if allowed,
   that could trick the proxy into relaying spam email.  Proxies that
   support CONNECT SHOULD restrict its use to a limited set of known
   ports or a configurable whitelist of safe request targets.

   A server MUST NOT send any Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length header
   fields in a 2xx (Successful) response to CONNECT.  A client MUST
   ignore any Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header fields received
   in a successful response to CONNECT.

   A payload within a CONNECT request message has no defined semantics;
   sending a payload body on a CONNECT request might cause some existing
   implementations to reject the request.

   Responses to the CONNECT method are not cacheable.</source>

          <source>The COPY method creates a duplicate of the source resource identified
   by the Request-URI, in the destination resource identified by the URI
   in the Destination header.  The Destination header MUST be present.
   The exact behavior of the COPY method depends on the type of the
   source resource.

   All WebDAV-compliant resources MUST support the COPY method.
   However, support for the COPY method does not guarantee the ability
   to copy a resource.  For example, separate programs may control

          <source>The COPY method on a collection without a Depth header MUST act as if
   a Depth header with value &quot;infinity&quot; was included.  A client may
   submit a Depth header on a COPY on a collection with a value of &quot;0&quot;
   or &quot;infinity&quot;.  Servers MUST support the &quot;0&quot; and &quot;infinity&quot; Depth
   header behaviors on WebDAV-compliant resources.

   An infinite-depth COPY instructs that the collection resource
   identified by the Request-URI is to be copied to the location
   identified by the URI in the Destination header, and all its internal
   member resources are to be copied to a location relative to it,
   recursively through all levels of the collection hierarchy.  Note
   that an infinite-depth COPY of /A/ into /A/B/ could lead to infinite
   recursion if not handled correctly.

   A COPY of &quot;Depth: 0&quot; only instructs that the collection and its
   properties, but not resources identified by its internal member URLs,
   are to be copied.

   Any headers included with a COPY MUST be applied in processing every
   resource to be copied with the exception of the Destination header.

   The Destination header only specifies the destination URI for the
   Request-URI.  When applied to members of the collection identified by
   the Request-URI, the value of Destination is to be modified to
   reflect the current location in the hierarchy.  So, if the Request-
   URI is /a/ with Host header value http://example.com/ and the 

   Destination is http://example.com/b/, then when
   http://example.com/a/c/d is processed, it must use a Destination of
   http://example.com/b/c/d.

   When the COPY method has completed processing, it MUST have created a
   consistent URL namespace at the destination (see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-5.1&quot;&gt;Section 5.1&lt;/a&gt; for the
   definition of namespace consistency).  However, if an error occurs
   while copying an internal collection, the server MUST NOT copy any
   resources identified by members of this collection (i.e., the server
   must skip this subtree), as this would create an inconsistent
   namespace.  After detecting an error, the COPY operation SHOULD try
   to finish as much of the original copy operation as possible (i.e.,
   the server should still attempt to copy other subtrees and their
   members that are not descendants of an error-causing collection).

   So, for example, if an infinite-depth copy operation is performed on
   collection /a/, which contains collections /a/b/ and /a/c/, and an
   error occurs copying /a/b/, an attempt should still be made to copy
   /a/c/.  Similarly, after encountering an error copying a non-
   collection resource as part of an infinite-depth copy, the server
   SHOULD try to finish as much of the original copy operation as
   possible.

   If an error in executing the COPY method occurs with a resource other
   than the resource identified in the Request-URI, then the response
   MUST be a 207 (Multi-Status), and the URL of the resource causing the
   failure MUST appear with the specific error.

   The 424 (Failed Dependency) status code SHOULD NOT be returned in the
   207 (Multi-Status) response from a COPY method.  These responses can
   be safely omitted because the client will know that the progeny of a
   resource could not be copied when the client receives an error for
   the parent.  Additionally, 201 (Created)/204 (No Content) status
   codes SHOULD NOT be returned as values in 207 (Multi-Status)
   responses from COPY methods.  They, too, can be safely omitted
   because they are the default success codes.</source>

    cache-extension = token [ &quot;=&quot; ( token | quoted-string ) ] 

   When a directive appears without any 1#field-name parameter, the
   directive applies to the entire request or response. When such a
   directive appears with a 1#field-name parameter, it applies only to
   the named field or fields, and not to the rest of the request or
   response. This mechanism supports extensibility; implementations of
   future versions of the HTTP protocol might apply these directives to
   header fields not defined in HTTP/1.1.

   The cache-control directives can be broken down into these general
   categories:

      - Restrictions on what are cacheable; these may only be imposed by
        the origin server.

      - Restrictions on what may be stored by a cache; these may be
        imposed by either the origin server or the user agent.

      - Modifications of the basic expiration mechanism; these may be
        imposed by either the origin server or the user agent.

      - Controls over cache revalidation and reload; these may only be
        imposed by a user agent.

      - Control over transformation of entities.

      - Extensions to the caching system.</source>

          <source>The Cache-Control header field can be extended through the use of one
   or more cache-extension tokens, each with an optional assigned value.
   Informational extensions (those which do not require a change in
   cache behavior) MAY be added without changing the semantics of other
   directives. Behavioral extensions are designed to work by acting as
   modifiers to the existing base of cache directives. Both the new
   directive and the standard directive are supplied, such that
   applications which do not understand the new directive will default
   to the behavior specified by the standard directive, and those that
   understand the new directive will recognize it as modifying the
   requirements associated with the standard directive. In this way,
   extensions to the cache-control directives can be made without
   requiring changes to the base protocol.

   This extension mechanism depends on an HTTP cache obeying all of the
   cache-control directives defined for its native HTTP-version, obeying
   certain extensions, and ignoring all directives that it does not
   understand.

   For example, consider a hypothetical new response directive called
   community which acts as a modifier to the private directive. We
   define this new directive to mean that, in addition to any non-shared
   cache, any cache which is shared only by members of the community
   named within its value may cache the response. An origin server
   wishing to allow the UCI community to use an otherwise private
   response in their shared cache(s) could do so by including

       Cache-Control: private, community=&quot;UCI&quot;

   A cache seeing this header field will act correctly even if the cache
   does not understand the community cache-extension, since it will also
   see and understand the private directive and thus default to the safe
   behavior. 

   Unrecognized cache-directives MUST be ignored; it is assumed that any
   cache-directive likely to be unrecognized by an HTTP/1.1 cache will
   be combined with standard directives (or the response's default
   cacheability) such that the cache behavior will remain minimally
   correct even if the cache does not understand the extension(s).</source>

          <source>The Connection general-header field allows the sender to specify
   options that are desired for that particular connection and MUST NOT
   be communicated by proxies over further connections.

   The Connection header has the following grammar:

       Connection = &quot;Connection&quot; &quot;:&quot; 1#(connection-token)
       connection-token  = token

   HTTP/1.1 proxies MUST parse the Connection header field before a
   message is forwarded and, for each connection-token in this field,
   remove any header field(s) from the message with the same name as the
   connection-token. Connection options are signaled by the presence of
   a connection-token in the Connection header field, not by any
   corresponding additional header field(s), since the additional header
   field may not be sent if there are no parameters associated with that
   connection option.

   Message headers listed in the Connection header MUST NOT include
   end-to-end headers, such as Cache-Control.

   HTTP/1.1 defines the &quot;close&quot; connection option for the sender to
   signal that the connection will be closed after completion of the
   response. For example,

       Connection: close

   in either the request or the response header fields indicates that
   the connection SHOULD NOT be considered `persistent' (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-8.1&quot;&gt;section 8.1&lt;/a&gt;)
   after the current request/response is complete.

   HTTP/1.1 applications that do not support persistent connections MUST
   include the &quot;close&quot; connection option in every message.

   A system receiving an HTTP/1.0 (or lower-version) message that
   includes a Connection header MUST, for each connection-token in this
   field, remove and ignore any header field(s) from the message with
   the same name as the connection-token. This protects against mistaken
   forwarding of such header fields by pre-HTTP/1.1 proxies. See &lt;a href=&quot;#section-19.6.2&quot;&gt;section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#section-19.6.2&quot;&gt;19.6.2&lt;/a&gt;.</source>

          <source>The Connection header field (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-6.1&quot;&gt;Section 6.1&lt;/a&gt;) provides a &quot;close&quot;
   connection option that a sender SHOULD send when it wishes to close
   the connection after the current request/response pair.

   A client that sends a &quot;close&quot; connection option MUST NOT send further
   requests on that connection (after the one containing &quot;close&quot;) and
   MUST close the connection after reading the final response message
   corresponding to this request.

   A server that receives a &quot;close&quot; connection option MUST initiate a
   close of the connection (see below) after it sends the final response
   to the request that contained &quot;close&quot;.  The server SHOULD send a
   &quot;close&quot; connection option in its final response on that connection.
   The server MUST NOT process any further requests received on that
   connection.

   A server that sends a &quot;close&quot; connection option MUST initiate a close
   of the connection (see below) after it sends the response containing
   &quot;close&quot;.  The server MUST NOT process any further requests received
   on that connection.

   A client that receives a &quot;close&quot; connection option MUST cease sending
   requests on that connection and close the connection after reading
   the response message containing the &quot;close&quot;; if additional pipelined
   requests had been sent on the connection, the client SHOULD NOT
   assume that they will be processed by the server. 

   If a server performs an immediate close of a TCP connection, there is
   a significant risk that the client will not be able to read the last
   HTTP response.  If the server receives additional data from the
   client on a fully closed connection, such as another request that was
   sent by the client before receiving the server's response, the
   server's TCP stack will send a reset packet to the client;
   unfortunately, the reset packet might erase the client's
   unacknowledged input buffers before they can be read and interpreted
   by the client's HTTP parser.

   To avoid the TCP reset problem, servers typically close a connection
   in stages.  First, the server performs a half-close by closing only
   the write side of the read/write connection.  The server then
   continues to read from the connection until it receives a
   corresponding close by the client, or until the server is reasonably
   certain that its own TCP stack has received the client's
   acknowledgement of the packet(s) containing the server's last
   response.  Finally, the server fully closes the connection.

   It is unknown whether the reset problem is exclusive to TCP or might
   also be found in other transport connection protocols.</source>

          <source>The Content-Disposition response-header field has been proposed as a
   means for the origin server to suggest a default filename if the user

   The receiving user agent SHOULD NOT respect any directory path

   If this header is used in a response with the application/octet-

   should not display the response, but directly enter a `save response

          <source>The Content-Encoding entity-header field is used as a modifier to the
   media-type. When present, its value indicates what additional content
   codings have been applied to the entity-body, and thus what decoding
   mechanisms must be applied in order to obtain the media-type
   referenced by the Content-Type header field. Content-Encoding is
   primarily used to allow a document to be compressed without losing
   the identity of its underlying media type.

       Content-Encoding  = &quot;Content-Encoding&quot; &quot;:&quot; 1#content-coding

   Content codings are defined in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.5&quot;&gt;section 3.5&lt;/a&gt;. An example of its use is

       Content-Encoding: gzip

   The content-coding is a characteristic of the entity identified by
   the Request-URI. Typically, the entity-body is stored with this
   encoding and is only decoded before rendering or analogous usage.
   However, a non-transparent proxy MAY modify the content-coding if the
   new coding is known to be acceptable to the recipient, unless the
   &quot;no-transform&quot; cache-control directive is present in the message.

   If the content-coding of an entity is not &quot;identity&quot;, then the

   If the content-coding of an entity in a request message is not
   acceptable to the origin server, the server SHOULD respond with a
   status code of 415 (Unsupported Media Type).

   If multiple encodings have been applied to an entity, the content
   codings MUST be listed in the order in which they were applied.

       Content-Language  = &quot;Content-Language&quot; &quot;:&quot; 1#language-tag 

   Language tags are defined in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.10&quot;&gt;section 3.10&lt;/a&gt;. The primary purpose of
   Content-Language is to allow a user to identify and differentiate
   entities according to the user's own preferred language. Thus, if the
   body content is intended only for a Danish-literate audience, the
   appropriate field is

       Content-Language: da

   If no Content-Language is specified, the default is that the content
   is intended for all language audiences. This might mean that the
   sender does not consider it to be specific to any natural language,
   or that the sender does not know for which language it is intended.

   Multiple languages MAY be listed for content that is intended for
   multiple audiences. For example, a rendition of the &quot;Treaty of
   Waitangi,&quot; presented simultaneously in the original Maori and English
   versions, would call for

       Content-Language: mi, en

   However, just because multiple languages are present within an entity
   does not mean that it is intended for multiple linguistic audiences.
   An example would be a beginner's language primer, such as &quot;A First
   Lesson in Latin,&quot; which is clearly intended to be used by an
   English-literate audience. In this case, the Content-Language would

       Content-Location = &quot;Content-Location&quot; &quot;:&quot;
                         ( absoluteURI | relativeURI )

   The value of Content-Location also defines the base URI for the

   The Content-Location value is not a replacement for the original
   requested URI; it is only a statement of the location of the resource
   corresponding to this particular entity at the time of the request.
   Future requests MAY specify the Content-Location URI as the request-
   URI if the desire is to identify the source of that particular
   entity.

   A cache cannot assume that an entity with a Content-Location
   different from the URI used to retrieve it can be used to respond to
   later requests on that Content-Location URI. However, the Content-

          <source>The Content-MD5 entity-header field, as defined in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1864&quot;&gt;RFC 1864&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-23&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;], is
   an MD5 digest of the entity-body for the purpose of providing an
   end-to-end message integrity check (MIC) of the entity-body. (Note: a
   MIC is good for detecting accidental modification of the entity-body
   in transit, but is not proof against malicious attacks.)

        Content-MD5   = &quot;Content-MD5&quot; &quot;:&quot; md5-digest
        md5-digest   = &amp;lt;base64 of 128 bit MD5 digest as per &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1864&quot;&gt;RFC 1864&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt;

   The Content-MD5 header field MAY be generated by an origin server or
   client to function as an integrity check of the entity-body. Only
   origin servers or clients MAY generate the Content-MD5 header field;
   proxies and gateways MUST NOT generate it, as this would defeat its
   value as an end-to-end integrity check. Any recipient of the entity-
   body, including gateways and proxies, MAY check that the digest value
   in this header field matches that of the entity-body as received.

   The MD5 digest is computed based on the content of the entity-body,
   including any content-coding that has been applied, but not including
   any transfer-encoding applied to the message-body. If the message is
   received with a transfer-encoding, that encoding MUST be removed
   prior to checking the Content-MD5 value against the received entity.

   This has the result that the digest is computed on the octets of the
   entity-body exactly as, and in the order that, they would be sent if
   no transfer-encoding were being applied.

   HTTP extends &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1864&quot;&gt;RFC 1864&lt;/a&gt; to permit the digest to be computed for MIME
   composite media-types (e.g., multipart/* and message/rfc822), but
   this does not change how the digest is computed as defined in the
   preceding paragraph.

   There are several consequences of this. The entity-body for composite
   types MAY contain many body-parts, each with its own MIME and HTTP
   headers (including Content-MD5, Content-Transfer-Encoding, and
   Content-Encoding headers). If a body-part has a Content-Transfer-
   Encoding or Content-Encoding header, it is assumed that the content
   of the body-part has had the encoding applied, and the body-part is
   included in the Content-MD5 digest as is -- i.e., after the
   application. The Transfer-Encoding header field is not allowed within
   body-parts.

   Conversion of all line breaks to CRLF MUST NOT be done before
   computing or checking the digest: the line break convention used in
   the text actually transmitted MUST be left unaltered when computing
   the digest. 

      Note: while the definition of Content-MD5 is exactly the same for
      HTTP as in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1864&quot;&gt;RFC 1864&lt;/a&gt; for MIME entity-bodies, there are several ways
      in which the application of Content-MD5 to HTTP entity-bodies
      differs from its application to MIME entity-bodies. One is that
      HTTP, unlike MIME, does not use Content-Transfer-Encoding, and
      does use Transfer-Encoding and Content-Encoding. Another is that
      HTTP more frequently uses binary content types than MIME, so it is
      worth noting that, in such cases, the byte order used to compute
      the digest is the transmission byte order defined for the type.
      Lastly, HTTP allows transmission of text types with any of several
      line break conventions and not just the canonical form using CRLF.</source>

       instance-length           = 1*DIGIT

   The header SHOULD indicate the total length of the full entity-body,
   unless this length is unknown or difficult to determine. The asterisk
   &quot;*&quot; character means that the instance-length is unknown at the time
   when the response was generated.

   Unlike byte-ranges-specifier values (see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.35.1&quot;&gt;section 14.35.1&lt;/a&gt;), a byte-
   range-resp-spec MUST only specify one range, and MUST contain
   absolute byte positions for both the first and last byte of the
   range.

   A byte-content-range-spec with a byte-range-resp-spec whose last-
   byte-pos value is less than its first-byte-pos value, or whose
   instance-length value is less than or equal to its last-byte-pos
   value, is invalid. The recipient of an invalid byte-content-range-
   spec MUST ignore it and any content transferred along with it.

   A server sending a response with status code 416 (Requested range not
   satisfiable) SHOULD include a Content-Range field with a byte-range-
   resp-spec of &quot;*&quot;. The instance-length specifies the current length of 

   the selected resource. A response with status code 206 (Partial
   Content) MUST NOT include a Content-Range field with a byte-range-
   resp-spec of &quot;*&quot;.

   Examples of byte-content-range-spec values, assuming that the entity
   contains a total of 1234 bytes:

      . The first 500 bytes:
       bytes 0-499/1234

      . The second 500 bytes:
       bytes 500-999/1234

      . All except for the first 500 bytes:
       bytes 500-1233/1234

      . The last 500 bytes:
       bytes 734-1233/1234

   When an HTTP message includes the content of a single range (for
   example, a response to a request for a single range, or to a request
   for a set of ranges that overlap without any holes), this content is
   transmitted with a Content-Range header, and a Content-Length header
   showing the number of bytes actually transferred. For example,

       HTTP/1.1 206 Partial content
       Date: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 06:25:24 GMT
       Last-Modified: Wed, 15 Nov 1995 04:58:08 GMT
       Content-Range: bytes 21010-47021/47022
       Content-Length: 26012
       Content-Type: image/gif

   When an HTTP message includes the content of multiple ranges (for
   example, a response to a request for multiple non-overlapping
   ranges), these are transmitted as a multipart message. The multipart
   media type used for this purpose is &quot;multipart/byteranges&quot; as defined
   in appendix 19.2. See appendix 19.6.3 for a compatibility issue.

   A response to a request for a single range MUST NOT be sent using the
   multipart/byteranges media type.  A response to a request for
   multiple ranges, whose result is a single range, MAY be sent as a
   multipart/byteranges media type with one part. A client that cannot
   decode a multipart/byteranges message MUST NOT ask for multiple
   byte-ranges in a single request.

   When a client requests multiple byte-ranges in one request, the
   server SHOULD return them in the order that they appeared in the
   request. 

   If the server ignores a byte-range-spec because it is syntactically
   invalid, the server SHOULD treat the request as if the invalid Range
   header field did not exist. (Normally, this means return a 200
   response containing the full entity).

   If the server receives a request (other than one including an If-
   Range request-header field) with an unsatisfiable Range request-
   header field (that is, all of whose byte-range-spec values have a
   first-byte-pos value greater than the current length of the selected
   resource), it SHOULD return a response code of 416 (Requested range
   not satisfiable) (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-10.4.17&quot;&gt;section 10.4.17&lt;/a&gt;).

      Note: clients cannot depend on servers to send a 416 (Requested
      range not satisfiable) response instead of a 200 (OK) response for
      an unsatisfiable Range request-header, since not all servers
      implement this request-header.</source>

   header was used on it.  A client MUST NOT submit a Depth header with
   a DELETE on a collection with any value but infinity.

   DELETE instructs that the collection specified in the Request-URI and
   all resources identified by its internal member URLs are to be
   deleted.

   If any resource identified by a member URL cannot be deleted, then
   all of the member's ancestors MUST NOT be deleted, so as to maintain
   URL namespace consistency.

   Any headers included with DELETE MUST be applied in processing every
   resource to be deleted.

   When the DELETE method has completed processing, it MUST result in a
   consistent URL namespace.

   If an error occurs deleting a member resource (a resource other than
   the resource identified in the Request-URI), then the response can be
   a 207 (Multi-Status).  Multi-Status is used here to indicate which
   internal resources could NOT be deleted, including an error code,
   which should help the client understand which resources caused the
   failure.  For example, the Multi-Status body could include a response
   with status 423 (Locked) if an internal resource was locked.

   The server MAY return a 4xx status response, rather than a 207, if
   the request failed completely.

   424 (Failed Dependency) status codes SHOULD NOT be in the 207 (Multi-
   Status) response for DELETE.  They can be safely left out because the
   client will know that the ancestors of a resource could not be
   deleted when the client receives an error for the ancestor's progeny.
   Additionally, 204 (No Content) errors SHOULD NOT be returned in the
   207 (Multi-Status).  The reason for this prohibition is that 204 (No
   Content) is the default success code.</source>

          <source>The DELETE method requests that the origin server delete the resource

   has been completed successfully. However, the server SHOULD NOT

   A successful response SHOULD be 200 (OK) if the response includes an

          <source>The DELETE method requests that the origin server remove the
   association between the target resource and its current
   functionality.  In effect, this method is similar to the rm command
   in UNIX: it expresses a deletion operation on the URI mapping of the
   origin server rather than an expectation that the previously
   associated information be deleted.

   If the target resource has one or more current representations, they
   might or might not be destroyed by the origin server, and the
   associated storage might or might not be reclaimed, depending
   entirely on the nature of the resource and its implementation by the
   origin server (which are beyond the scope of this specification).
   Likewise, other implementation aspects of a resource might need to be
   deactivated or archived as a result of a DELETE, such as database or
   gateway connections.  In general, it is assumed that the origin
   server will only allow DELETE on resources for which it has a
   prescribed mechanism for accomplishing the deletion.

   Relatively few resources allow the DELETE method -- its primary use
   is for remote authoring environments, where the user has some
   direction regarding its effect.  For example, a resource that was
   previously created using a PUT request, or identified via the
   Location header field after a 201 (Created) response to a POST
   request, might allow a corresponding DELETE request to undo those
   actions.  Similarly, custom user agent implementations that implement 

   an authoring function, such as revision control clients using HTTP
   for remote operations, might use DELETE based on an assumption that
   the server's URI space has been crafted to correspond to a version
   repository.

   If a DELETE method is successfully applied, the origin server SHOULD
   send a 202 (Accepted) status code if the action will likely succeed
   but has not yet been enacted, a 204 (No Content) status code if the
   action has been enacted and no further information is to be supplied,
   or a 200 (OK) status code if the action has been enacted and the
   response message includes a representation describing the status.

   A payload within a DELETE request message has no defined semantics;
   sending a payload body on a DELETE request might cause some existing
   implementations to reject the request.

   Responses to the DELETE method are not cacheable.  If a DELETE
   request passes through a cache that has one or more stored responses
   for the effective request URI, those stored responses will be
   invalidated (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.4&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;4.4 of [RFC7234]&lt;/a&gt;).</source>

       Date  = &quot;Date&quot; &quot;:&quot; HTTP-date

   An example is

       Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT

   Origin servers MUST include a Date header field in all responses,
   except in these cases: 

      1. If the response status code is 100 (Continue) or 101 (Switching
         Protocols), the response MAY include a Date header field, at
         the server's option.

      2. If the response status code conveys a server error, e.g. 500
         (Internal Server Error) or 503 (Service Unavailable), and it is
         inconvenient or impossible to generate a valid Date.

      3. If the server does not have a clock that can provide a
         reasonable approximation of the current time, its responses
         MUST NOT include a Date header field. In this case, the rules
         in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.18.1&quot;&gt;section 14.18.1&lt;/a&gt; MUST be followed.

   A received message that does not have a Date header field MUST be
   assigned one by the recipient if the message will be cached by that
   recipient or gatewayed via a protocol which requires a Date. An HTTP
   implementation without a clock MUST NOT cache responses without
   revalidating them on every use. An HTTP cache, especially a shared
   cache, SHOULD use a mechanism, such as NTP [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-28&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;], to synchronize its
   clock with a reliable external standard.

   Clients SHOULD only send a Date header field in messages that include
   an entity-body, as in the case of the PUT and POST requests, and even
   then it is optional. A client without a clock MUST NOT send a Date
   header field in a request.

   The HTTP-date sent in a Date header SHOULD NOT represent a date and
   time subsequent to the generation of the message. It SHOULD represent
   the best available approximation of the date and time of message
   generation, unless the implementation has no means of generating a
   reasonably accurate date and time. In theory, the date ought to
   represent the moment just before the entity is generated. In
   practice, the date can be generated at any time during the message
   origination without affecting its semantic value.</source>

          <source>The Depth header may be used with the LOCK method.  Values other than
   0 or infinity MUST NOT be used with the Depth header on a LOCK
   method.  All resources that support the LOCK method MUST support the
   Depth header.

   A Depth header of value 0 means to just lock the resource specified
   by the Request-URI.

   If the Depth header is set to infinity, then the resource specified
   in the Request-URI along with all its members, all the way down the
   hierarchy, are to be locked.  A successful result MUST return a
   single lock token.  Similarly, if an UNLOCK is successfully executed
   on this token, all associated resources are unlocked.  Hence, partial
   success is not an option for LOCK or UNLOCK.  Either the entire
   hierarchy is locked or no resources are locked.

   If the lock cannot be granted to all resources, the server MUST
   return a Multi-Status response with a 'response' element for at least
   one resource that prevented the lock from being granted, along with a
   suitable status code for that failure (e.g., 403 (Forbidden) or 423
   (Locked)).  Additionally, if the resource causing the failure was not
   the resource requested, then the server SHOULD include a 'response'
   element for the Request-URI as well, with a 'status' element
   containing 424 Failed Dependency.

   A server that does not understand or is unable to comply with any of
   the expectation values in the Expect field of a request MUST respond
   with appropriate error status. The server MUST respond with a 417
   (Expectation Failed) status if any of the expectations cannot be met
   or, if there are other problems with the request, some other 4xx
   status.

   This header field is defined with extensible syntax to allow for
   future extensions. If a server receives a request containing an
   Expect field that includes an expectation-extension that it does not
   support, it MUST respond with a 417 (Expectation Failed) status.

   Comparison of expectation values is case-insensitive for unquoted
   tokens (including the 100-continue token), and is case-sensitive for
   quoted-string expectation-extensions. 

   The Expect mechanism is hop-by-hop: that is, an HTTP/1.1 proxy MUST
   return a 417 (Expectation Failed) status if it receives a request
   with an expectation that it cannot meet. However, the Expect
   request-header itself is end-to-end; it MUST be forwarded if the
   request is forwarded.

          <source>The Expires entity-header field gives the date/time after which the

   unless it is first validated with the origin server (or with an
   intermediate cache that has a fresh copy of the entity). See &lt;a href=&quot;#section-13.2&quot;&gt;section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#section-13.2&quot;&gt;13.2&lt;/a&gt; for further discussion of the expiration model.

   The presence of an Expires field does not imply that the original

   An example of its use is

      Expires: Thu, 01 Dec 1994 16:00:00 GMT

      Note: if a response includes a Cache-Control field with the max-
      age directive (see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.9.3&quot;&gt;section 14.9.3&lt;/a&gt;), that directive overrides the
      Expires field.

   HTTP/1.1 clients and caches MUST treat other invalid date formats,
   especially including the value &quot;0&quot;, as in the past (i.e., &quot;already
   expired&quot;).

   To mark a response as &quot;already expired,&quot; an origin server sends an
   Expires date that is equal to the Date header value. (See the rules
   for expiration calculations in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-13.2.4&quot;&gt;section 13.2.4&lt;/a&gt;.) 

   To mark a response as &quot;never expires,&quot; an origin server sends an

   This header field MAY be used for logging purposes and as a means for
   identifying the source of invalid or unwanted requests. It SHOULD NOT
   be used as an insecure form of access protection. The interpretation
   of this field is that the request is being performed on behalf of the
   person given, who accepts responsibility for the method performed. In
   particular, robot agents SHOULD include this header so that the
   person responsible for running the robot can be contacted if problems
   occur on the receiving end.

   The Internet e-mail address in this field MAY be separate from the
   Internet host which issued the request. For example, when a request
   is passed through a proxy the original issuer's address SHOULD be
   used.

   The client SHOULD NOT send the From header field without the user's
   approval, as it might conflict with the user's privacy interests or
   their site's security policy. It is strongly recommended that the
   user be able to disable, enable, and modify the value of this field
   at any time prior to a request.</source>

          <source>The GET method means retrieve whatever information (in the form of an
   entity) is identified by the Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers
   to a data-producing process, it is the produced data which shall be
   returned as the entity in the response and not the source text of the
   process, unless that text happens to be the output of the process.

   The semantics of the GET method change to a &quot;conditional GET&quot; if the
   request message includes an If-Modified-Since, If-Unmodified-Since,
   If-Match, If-None-Match, or If-Range header field. A conditional GET
   method requests that the entity be transferred only under the
   circumstances described by the conditional header field(s). The
   conditional GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary network
   usage by allowing cached entities to be refreshed without requiring
   multiple requests or transferring data already held by the client.

   The semantics of the GET method change to a &quot;partial GET&quot; if the
   request message includes a Range header field. A partial GET requests
   that only part of the entity be transferred, as described in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.35&quot;&gt;section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.35&quot;&gt;14.35&lt;/a&gt;. The partial GET method is intended to reduce unnecessary
   network usage by allowing partially-retrieved entities to be
   completed without transferring data already held by the client.

   The response to a GET request is cacheable if and only if it meets
   the requirements for HTTP caching described in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-13&quot;&gt;section 13&lt;/a&gt;.

          <source>The GET method requests transfer of a current selected representation
   for the target resource.  GET is the primary mechanism of information
   retrieval and the focus of almost all performance optimizations.
   Hence, when people speak of retrieving some identifiable information
   via HTTP, they are generally referring to making a GET request.

   It is tempting to think of resource identifiers as remote file system
   pathnames and of representations as being a copy of the contents of
   such files.  In fact, that is how many resources are implemented (see
   &lt;a href=&quot;#section-9.1&quot;&gt;Section 9.1&lt;/a&gt; for related security considerations).  However, there are
   no such limitations in practice.  The HTTP interface for a resource
   is just as likely to be implemented as a tree of content objects, a
   programmatic view on various database records, or a gateway to other
   information systems.  Even when the URI mapping mechanism is tied to
   a file system, an origin server might be configured to execute the
   files with the request as input and send the output as the
   representation rather than transfer the files directly.  Regardless,
   only the origin server needs to know how each of its resource 

   identifiers corresponds to an implementation and how each
   implementation manages to select and send a current representation of
   the target resource in a response to GET.

   A client can alter the semantics of GET to be a &quot;range request&quot;,
   requesting transfer of only some part(s) of the selected
   representation, by sending a Range header field in the request
   ([&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233&quot;&gt;RFC7233&lt;/a&gt;]).

   A payload within a GET request message has no defined semantics;
   sending a payload body on a GET request might cause some existing
   implementations to reject the request.

   The response to a GET request is cacheable; a cache MAY use it to
   satisfy subsequent GET and HEAD requests unless otherwise indicated
   by the Cache-Control header field (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.2&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;5.2 of [RFC7234]&lt;/a&gt;).</source>

   be used for obtaining metainformation about the entity implied by the
   request without transferring the entity-body itself. This method is
   often used for testing hypertext links for validity, accessibility,
   and recent modification.

   The response to a HEAD request MAY be cacheable in the sense that the
   information contained in the response MAY be used to update a
   previously cached entity from that resource. If the new field values
   indicate that the cached entity differs from the current entity (as
   would be indicated by a change in Content-Length, Content-MD5, ETag
   or Last-Modified), then the cache MUST treat the cache entry as

          <source>The HTTP URL namespace is a hierarchical namespace where the
   hierarchy is delimited with the &quot;/&quot; character.

   An HTTP URL namespace is said to be consistent if it meets the
   following conditions: for every URL in the HTTP hierarchy there
   exists a collection that contains that URL as an internal member URL.
   The root, or top-level collection of the namespace under
   consideration, is exempt from the previous rule.  The top-level
   collection of the namespace under consideration is not necessarily
   the collection identified by the absolute path '/' -- it may be
   identified by one or more path segments (e.g., /servlets/webdav/...)

   Neither HTTP/1.1 nor WebDAV requires that the entire HTTP URL
   namespace be consistent -- a WebDAV-compatible resource may not have
   a parent collection.  However, certain WebDAV methods are prohibited
   from producing results that cause namespace inconsistencies.

   As is implicit in [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616&quot;&gt;RFC2616&lt;/a&gt;] and [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986&quot;&gt;RFC3986&lt;/a&gt;], any resource, including

          <source>The HTTP authentication framework does not define a single mechanism
   for maintaining the confidentiality of credentials; instead, each
   authentication scheme defines how the credentials are encoded prior
   to transmission.  While this provides flexibility for the development
   of future authentication schemes, it is inadequate for the protection
   of existing schemes that provide no confidentiality on their own, or
   that do not sufficiently protect against replay attacks.
   Furthermore, if the server expects credentials that are specific to
   each individual user, the exchange of those credentials will have the
   effect of identifying that user even if the content within
   credentials remains confidential.

   HTTP depends on the security properties of the underlying transport-
   or session-level connection to provide confidential transmission of
   header fields.  In other words, if a server limits access to
   authenticated users using this framework, the server needs to ensure
   that the connection is properly secured in accordance with the nature
   of the authentication scheme used.  For example, services that depend
   on individual user authentication often require a connection to be
   secured with TLS (&quot;Transport Layer Security&quot;, [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246&quot;&gt;RFC5246&lt;/a&gt;]) prior to

          <source>The HTTP protocol is a request/response protocol. A client sends a
   request to the server in the form of a request method, URI, and
   protocol version, followed by a MIME-like message containing request
   modifiers, client information, and possible body content over a
   connection with a server. The server responds with a status line,
   including the message's protocol version and a success or error code,
   followed by a MIME-like message containing server information, entity
   metainformation, and possible entity-body content. The relationship
   between HTTP and MIME is described in appendix 19.4.

   Most HTTP communication is initiated by a user agent and consists of
   a request to be applied to a resource on some origin server. In the
   simplest case, this may be accomplished via a single connection (v)
   between the user agent (UA) and the origin server (O).

          request chain ------------------------&amp;gt;
       UA -------------------v------------------- O
          &amp;lt;----------------------- response chain

   A more complicated situation occurs when one or more intermediaries
   are present in the request/response chain. There are three common
   forms of intermediary: proxy, gateway, and tunnel. A proxy is a
   forwarding agent, receiving requests for a URI in its absolute form,
   rewriting all or part of the message, and forwarding the reformatted
   request toward the server identified by the URI. A gateway is a
   receiving agent, acting as a layer above some other server(s) and, if
   necessary, translating the requests to the underlying server's
   protocol. A tunnel acts as a relay point between two connections
   without changing the messages; tunnels are used when the
   communication needs to pass through an intermediary (such as a
   firewall) even when the intermediary cannot understand the contents
   of the messages.

          request chain --------------------------------------&amp;gt;
       UA -----v----- A -----v----- B -----v----- C -----v----- O
          &amp;lt;------------------------------------- response chain

   The figure above shows three intermediaries (A, B, and C) between the
   user agent and origin server. A request or response message that
   travels the whole chain will pass through four separate connections.
   This distinction is important because some HTTP communication options 

   may apply only to the connection with the nearest, non-tunnel
   neighbor, only to the end-points of the chain, or to all connections
   along the chain. Although the diagram is linear, each participant may
   be engaged in multiple, simultaneous communications. For example, B
   may be receiving requests from many clients other than A, and/or
   forwarding requests to servers other than C, at the same time that it
   is handling A's request.

   Any party to the communication which is not acting as a tunnel may
   employ an internal cache for handling requests. The effect of a cache
   is that the request/response chain is shortened if one of the
   participants along the chain has a cached response applicable to that
   request. The following illustrates the resulting chain if B has a
   cached copy of an earlier response from O (via C) for a request which
   has not been cached by UA or A.

          request chain ----------&amp;gt;
       UA -----v----- A -----v----- B - - - - - - C - - - - - - O
          &amp;lt;--------- response chain

   Not all responses are usefully cacheable, and some requests may
   contain modifiers which place special requirements on cache behavior.
   HTTP requirements for cache behavior and cacheable responses are
   defined in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-13&quot;&gt;section 13&lt;/a&gt;.

   In fact, there are a wide variety of architectures and configurations
   of caches and proxies currently being experimented with or deployed
   across the World Wide Web. These systems include national hierarchies
   of proxy caches to save transoceanic bandwidth, systems that
   broadcast or multicast cache entries, organizations that distribute
   subsets of cached data via CD-ROM, and so on. HTTP systems are used
   in corporate intranets over high-bandwidth links, and for access via
   PDAs with low-power radio links and intermittent connectivity. The
   goal of HTTP/1.1 is to support the wide diversity of configurations
   already deployed while introducing protocol constructs that meet the
   needs of those who build web applications that require high
   reliability and, failing that, at least reliable indications of
   failure.

   HTTP communication usually takes place over TCP/IP connections. The
   default port is TCP 80 [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-19&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;], but other ports can be used. This does
   not preclude HTTP from being implemented on top of any other protocol
   on the Internet, or on other networks. HTTP only presumes a reliable
   transport; any protocol that provides such guarantees can be used;
   the mapping of the HTTP/1.1 request and response structures onto the
   transport data units of the protocol in question is outside the scope
   of this specification. 

   In HTTP/1.0, most implementations used a new connection for each
   request/response exchange. In HTTP/1.1, a connection may be used for
   one or more request/response exchanges, although connections may be
   closed for a variety of reasons (see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-8.1&quot;&gt;section 8.1&lt;/a&gt;).</source>

The server uses the &lt;a href=&quot;headers/vary&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Vary&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; header to indicate which headers it actually used for content negotiation (or more precisely the associated response headers), so that &lt;a href=&quot;caching&quot;&gt;caches&lt;/a&gt; can work optimally.</source>

          <source>The Host request-header field specifies the Internet host and port
   number of the resource being requested, as obtained from the original
   URI given by the user or referring resource (generally an HTTP URL, 

   as described in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.2.2&quot;&gt;section 3.2.2&lt;/a&gt;). The Host field value MUST represent
   the naming authority of the origin server or gateway given by the
   original URL. This allows the origin server or gateway to
   differentiate between internally-ambiguous URLs, such as the root &quot;/&quot;
   URL of a server for multiple host names on a single IP address.

       Host = &quot;Host&quot; &quot;:&quot; host [ &quot;:&quot; port ] ; &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.2.2&quot;&gt;Section 3.2.2&lt;/a&gt;

   A &quot;host&quot; without any trailing port information implies the default
   port for the service requested (e.g., &quot;80&quot; for an HTTP URL). For
   example, a request on the origin server for
   &amp;lt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/&quot;&gt;http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/&lt;/a&gt;&amp;gt; would properly include:

       GET /pub/WWW/ HTTP/1.1
       Host: www.w3.org

   A client MUST include a Host header field in all HTTP/1.1 request
   messages . If the requested URI does not include an Internet host
   name for the service being requested, then the Host header field MUST
   be given with an empty value. An HTTP/1.1 proxy MUST ensure that any
   request message it forwards does contain an appropriate Host header
   field that identifies the service being requested by the proxy. All
   Internet-based HTTP/1.1 servers MUST respond with a 400 (Bad Request)
   status code to any HTTP/1.1 request message which lacks a Host header
   field.

          <source>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-
   level request/response protocol that uses extensible semantics and
   self-descriptive message payloads for flexible interaction with
   network-based hypertext information systems.  This document is the
   first in a series of documents that collectively form the HTTP/1.1
   specification:

   1.  &quot;Message Syntax and Routing&quot; (this document)

   2.  &quot;Semantics and Content&quot; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231&quot;&gt;RFC7231&lt;/a&gt;]

   3.  &quot;Conditional Requests&quot; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232&quot;&gt;RFC7232&lt;/a&gt;]

   4.  &quot;Range Requests&quot; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233&quot;&gt;RFC7233&lt;/a&gt;]

   5.  &quot;Caching&quot; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234&quot;&gt;RFC7234&lt;/a&gt;]

   6.  &quot;Authentication&quot; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235&quot;&gt;RFC7235&lt;/a&gt;]

   This HTTP/1.1 specification obsoletes &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616&quot;&gt;RFC 2616&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2145&quot;&gt;RFC 2145&lt;/a&gt; (on HTTP
   versioning).  This specification also updates the use of CONNECT to
   establish a tunnel, previously defined in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2817&quot;&gt;RFC 2817&lt;/a&gt;, and defines the
   &quot;https&quot; URI scheme that was described informally in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2818&quot;&gt;RFC 2818&lt;/a&gt;.

   HTTP is a generic interface protocol for information systems.  It is
   designed to hide the details of how a service is implemented by
   presenting a uniform interface to clients that is independent of the
   types of resources provided.  Likewise, servers do not need to be
   aware of each client's purpose: an HTTP request can be considered in
   isolation rather than being associated with a specific type of client
   or a predetermined sequence of application steps.  The result is a
   protocol that can be used effectively in many different contexts and
   for which implementations can evolve independently over time.

   HTTP is also designed for use as an intermediation protocol for
   translating communication to and from non-HTTP information systems.
   HTTP proxies and gateways can provide access to alternative
   information services by translating their diverse protocols into a
   hypertext format that can be viewed and manipulated by clients in the
   same way as HTTP services.

   One consequence of this flexibility is that the protocol cannot be
   defined in terms of what occurs behind the interface.  Instead, we
   are limited to defining the syntax of communication, the intent of
   received communication, and the expected behavior of recipients.  If
   the communication is considered in isolation, then successful actions 

   ought to be reflected in corresponding changes to the observable
   interface provided by servers.  However, since multiple clients might
   act in parallel and perhaps at cross-purposes, we cannot require that
   such changes be observable beyond the scope of a single response.

   This document describes the architectural elements that are used or
   referred to in HTTP, defines the &quot;http&quot; and &quot;https&quot; URI schemes,
   describes overall network operation and connection management, and
   defines HTTP message framing and forwarding requirements.  Our goal
   is to define all of the mechanisms necessary for HTTP message
   handling that are independent of message semantics, thereby defining
   the complete set of requirements for message parsers and message-
   forwarding intermediaries.</source>

          <source>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
   protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
   systems. HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global
   information initiative since 1990. The first version of HTTP,
   referred to as HTTP/0.9, was a simple protocol for raw data transfer
   across the Internet. HTTP/1.0, as defined by &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1945&quot;&gt;RFC 1945&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;], improved
   the protocol by allowing messages to be in the format of MIME-like
   messages, containing metainformation about the data transferred and
   modifiers on the request/response semantics. However, HTTP/1.0 does
   not sufficiently take into consideration the effects of hierarchical
   proxies, caching, the need for persistent connections, or virtual
   hosts. In addition, the proliferation of incompletely-implemented
   applications calling themselves &quot;HTTP/1.0&quot; has necessitated a
   protocol version change in order for two communicating applications
   to determine each other's true capabilities.

   This specification defines the protocol referred to as &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot;.
   This protocol includes more stringent requirements than HTTP/1.0 in
   order to ensure reliable implementation of its features.

   Practical information systems require more functionality than simple
   retrieval, including search, front-end update, and annotation. HTTP
   allows an open-ended set of methods and headers that indicate the
   purpose of a request [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-47&quot;&gt;47&lt;/a&gt;]. It builds on the discipline of reference
   provided by the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;], as a location
   (URL) [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;] or name (URN) [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-20&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;], for indicating the resource to which a 

   method is to be applied. Messages are passed in a format similar to
   that used by Internet mail [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;] as defined by the Multipurpose
   Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;].

   HTTP is also used as a generic protocol for communication between
   user agents and proxies/gateways to other Internet systems, including

          <source>The If header has two distinct purposes:

   o  The first purpose is to make a request conditional by supplying a
      series of state lists with conditions that match tokens and ETags
      to a specific resource.  If this header is evaluated and all state
      lists fail, then the request MUST fail with a 412 (Precondition
      Failed) status.  On the other hand, the request can succeed only
      if one of the described state lists succeeds.  The success
      criteria for state lists and matching functions are defined in
      Sections &lt;a href=&quot;#section-10.4.3&quot;&gt;10.4.3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#section-10.4.4&quot;&gt;10.4.4&lt;/a&gt;.

   o  Additionally, the mere fact that a state token appears in an If
      header means that it has been &quot;submitted&quot; with the request.  In
      general, this is used to indicate that the client has knowledge of
      that state token.  The semantics for submitting a state token
      depend on its type (for lock tokens, please refer to &lt;a href=&quot;#section-6&quot;&gt;Section 6&lt;/a&gt;).

   Note that these two purposes need to be treated distinctly: a state
   token counts as being submitted independently of whether the server
   actually has evaluated the state list it appears in, and also
   independently of whether or not the condition it expressed was found
   to be true.</source>

          <source>The If-Match request-header field is used with a method to make it
   conditional. A client that has one or more entities previously
   obtained from the resource can verify that one of those entities is
   current by including a list of their associated entity tags in the
   If-Match header field. Entity tags are defined in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.11&quot;&gt;section 3.11&lt;/a&gt;. The
   purpose of this feature is to allow efficient updates of cached
   information with a minimum amount of transaction overhead. It is also
   used, on updating requests, to prevent inadvertent modification of
   the wrong version of a resource. As a special case, the value &quot;*&quot;
   matches any current entity of the resource.

       If-Match = &quot;If-Match&quot; &quot;:&quot; ( &quot;*&quot; | 1#entity-tag )

   If any of the entity tags match the entity tag of the entity that
   would have been returned in the response to a similar GET request
   (without the If-Match header) on that resource, or if &quot;*&quot; is given 

   and any current entity exists for that resource, then the server MAY
   perform the requested method as if the If-Match header field did not
   exist.

   A server MUST use the strong comparison function (see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-13.3.3&quot;&gt;section 13.3.3&lt;/a&gt;)
   to compare the entity tags in If-Match.

   If none of the entity tags match, or if &quot;*&quot; is given and no current
   entity exists, the server MUST NOT perform the requested method, and
   MUST return a 412 (Precondition Failed) response. This behavior is
   most useful when the client wants to prevent an updating method, such
   as PUT, from modifying a resource that has changed since the client
   last retrieved it.

   If the request would, without the If-Match header field, result in
   anything other than a 2xx or 412 status, then the If-Match header
   MUST be ignored.

   The meaning of &quot;If-Match: *&quot; is that the method SHOULD be performed
   if the representation selected by the origin server (or by a cache,
   possibly using the Vary mechanism, see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.44&quot;&gt;section 14.44&lt;/a&gt;) exists, and
   MUST NOT be performed if the representation does not exist.

   A request intended to update a resource (e.g., a PUT) MAY include an
   If-Match header field to signal that the request method MUST NOT be
   applied if the entity corresponding to the If-Match value (a single
   entity tag) is no longer a representation of that resource. This
   allows the user to indicate that they do not wish the request to be
   successful if the resource has been changed without their knowledge.
   Examples:

       If-Match: &quot;xyzzy&quot;
       If-Match: &quot;xyzzy&quot;, &quot;r2d2xxxx&quot;, &quot;c3piozzzz&quot;

          <source>The If-Modified-Since request-header field is used with a method to
   make it conditional: if the requested variant has not been modified
   since the time specified in this field, an entity will not be
   returned from the server; instead, a 304 (not modified) response will
   be returned without any message-body.

       If-Modified-Since = &quot;If-Modified-Since&quot; &quot;:&quot; HTTP-date 

   An example of the field is:

       If-Modified-Since: Sat, 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT

   A GET method with an If-Modified-Since header and no Range header
   requests that the identified entity be transferred only if it has
   been modified since the date given by the If-Modified-Since header.
   The algorithm for determining this includes the following cases:

      a) If the request would normally result in anything other than a
         200 (OK) status, or if the passed If-Modified-Since date is
         invalid, the response is exactly the same as for a normal GET.
         A date which is later than the server's current time is
         invalid.

      b) If the variant has been modified since the If-Modified-Since
         date, the response is exactly the same as for a normal GET.

      c) If the variant has not been modified since a valid If-
         Modified-Since date, the server SHOULD return a 304 (Not
         Modified) response.

   The purpose of this feature is to allow efficient updates of cached
   information with a minimum amount of transaction overhead.

      Note: The Range request-header field modifies the meaning of If-
      Modified-Since; see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.35&quot;&gt;section 14.35&lt;/a&gt; for full details.

      Note: If-Modified-Since times are interpreted by the server, whose
      clock might not be synchronized with the client.

      Note: When handling an If-Modified-Since header field, some
      servers will use an exact date comparison function, rather than a
      less-than function, for deciding whether to send a 304 (Not
      Modified) response. To get best results when sending an If-
      Modified-Since header field for cache validation, clients are
      advised to use the exact date string received in a previous Last-
      Modified header field whenever possible.

      Note: If a client uses an arbitrary date in the If-Modified-Since
      header instead of a date taken from the Last-Modified header for
      the same request, the client should be aware of the fact that this
      date is interpreted in the server's understanding of time. The
      client should consider unsynchronized clocks and rounding problems
      due to the different encodings of time between the client and
      server. This includes the possibility of race conditions if the
      document has changed between the time it was first requested and
      the If-Modified-Since date of a subsequent request, and the 

      possibility of clock-skew-related problems if the If-Modified-
      Since date is derived from the client's clock without correction
      to the server's clock. Corrections for different time bases
      between client and server are at best approximate due to network
      latency.

   The result of a request having both an If-Modified-Since header field
   and either an If-Match or an If-Unmodified-Since header fields is
   undefined by this specification.</source>

          <source>The If-None-Match request-header field is used with a method to make
   it conditional. A client that has one or more entities previously
   obtained from the resource can verify that none of those entities is
   current by including a list of their associated entity tags in the
   If-None-Match header field. The purpose of this feature is to allow
   efficient updates of cached information with a minimum amount of
   transaction overhead. It is also used to prevent a method (e.g. PUT)
   from inadvertently modifying an existing resource when the client
   believes that the resource does not exist.

   As a special case, the value &quot;*&quot; matches any current entity of the
   resource.

       If-None-Match = &quot;If-None-Match&quot; &quot;:&quot; ( &quot;*&quot; | 1#entity-tag )

   If any of the entity tags match the entity tag of the entity that
   would have been returned in the response to a similar GET request
   (without the If-None-Match header) on that resource, or if &quot;*&quot; is
   given and any current entity exists for that resource, then the
   server MUST NOT perform the requested method, unless required to do
   so because the resource's modification date fails to match that
   supplied in an If-Modified-Since header field in the request.
   Instead, if the request method was GET or HEAD, the server SHOULD
   respond with a 304 (Not Modified) response, including the cache-
   related header fields (particularly ETag) of one of the entities that
   matched. For all other request methods, the server MUST respond with
   a status of 412 (Precondition Failed).

   See &lt;a href=&quot;#section-13.3.3&quot;&gt;section 13.3.3&lt;/a&gt; for rules on how to determine if two entities tags
   match. The weak comparison function can only be used with GET or HEAD
   requests. 

   If none of the entity tags match, then the server MAY perform the
   requested method as if the If-None-Match header field did not exist,
   but MUST also ignore any If-Modified-Since header field(s) in the
   request. That is, if no entity tags match, then the server MUST NOT
   return a 304 (Not Modified) response.

   If the request would, without the If-None-Match header field, result
   in anything other than a 2xx or 304 status, then the If-None-Match
   header MUST be ignored. (See &lt;a href=&quot;#section-13.3.4&quot;&gt;section 13.3.4&lt;/a&gt; for a discussion of
   server behavior when both If-Modified-Since and If-None-Match appear
   in the same request.)

   The meaning of &quot;If-None-Match: *&quot; is that the method MUST NOT be
   performed if the representation selected by the origin server (or by
   a cache, possibly using the Vary mechanism, see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.44&quot;&gt;section 14.44&lt;/a&gt;)
   exists, and SHOULD be performed if the representation does not exist.
   This feature is intended to be useful in preventing races between PUT
   operations.

   Examples:

       If-None-Match: &quot;xyzzy&quot;
       If-None-Match: W/&quot;xyzzy&quot;

   which the origin server believes the variant was last modified.

       Last-Modified  = &quot;Last-Modified&quot; &quot;:&quot; HTTP-date 

   An example of its use is

       Last-Modified: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 12:45:26 GMT

   The exact meaning of this header field depends on the implementation
   of the origin server and the nature of the original resource. For
   files, it may be just the file system last-modified time. For
   entities with dynamically included parts, it may be the most recent
   of the set of last-modify times for its component parts. For database
   gateways, it may be the last-update time stamp of the record. For
   virtual objects, it may be the last time the internal state changed.

   An origin server MUST NOT send a Last-Modified date which is later
   than the server's time of message origination. In such cases, where
   the resource's last modification would indicate some time in the
   future, the server MUST replace that date with the message
   origination date.

   An origin server SHOULD obtain the Last-Modified value of the entity
   as close as possible to the time that it generates the Date value of
   its response. This allows a recipient to make an accurate assessment
   of the entity's modification time, especially if the entity changes
   near the time that the response is generated.

   HTTP/1.1 servers SHOULD send Last-Modified whenever feasible.</source>

   responses, the Location is that of the new resource which was created
   by the request. For 3xx responses, the location SHOULD indicate the
   server's preferred URI for automatic redirection to the resource. The
   field value consists of a single absolute URI.

       Location       = &quot;Location&quot; &quot;:&quot; absoluteURI

   maintenance step allows the server to perform updates caused by the
   move, such as updating all URLs, other than the Request-URI that
   identifies the source resource, to point to the new destination
   resource. 

   The Destination header MUST be present on all MOVE methods and MUST
   follow all COPY requirements for the COPY part of the MOVE method.
   All WebDAV-compliant resources MUST support the MOVE method.

   Support for the MOVE method does not guarantee the ability to move a

   The list of methods allowed by a resource can be specified in an
   Allow header field (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.7&quot;&gt;section 14.7&lt;/a&gt;). The return code of the response
   always notifies the client whether a method is currently allowed on a
   resource, since the set of allowed methods can change dynamically. An
   origin server SHOULD return the status code 405 (Method Not Allowed)
   if the method is known by the origin server but not allowed for the
   requested resource, and 501 (Not Implemented) if the method is
   unrecognized or not implemented by the origin server. The methods GET
   and HEAD MUST be supported by all general-purpose servers. All other
   methods are OPTIONAL; however, if the above methods are implemented,

          <source>The OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the
   communication options available on the request/response chain
   identified by the Request-URI. This method allows the client to
   determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource,
   or the capabilities of a server, without implying a resource action
   or initiating a resource retrieval.

   Responses to this method are not cacheable.

   If the OPTIONS request includes an entity-body (as indicated by the
   presence of Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding), then the media type
   MUST be indicated by a Content-Type field. Although this
   specification does not define any use for such a body, future
   extensions to HTTP might use the OPTIONS body to make more detailed
   queries on the server. A server that does not support such an
   extension MAY discard the request body.

   If the Request-URI is an asterisk (&quot;*&quot;), the OPTIONS request is
   intended to apply to the server in general rather than to a specific
   resource. Since a server's communication options typically depend on
   the resource, the &quot;*&quot; request is only useful as a &quot;ping&quot; or &quot;no-op&quot;
   type of method; it does nothing beyond allowing the client to test
   the capabilities of the server. For example, this can be used to test
   a proxy for HTTP/1.1 compliance (or lack thereof).

   If the Request-URI is not an asterisk, the OPTIONS request applies
   only to the options that are available when communicating with that
   resource.

   A 200 response SHOULD include any header fields that indicate
   optional features implemented by the server and applicable to that
   resource (e.g., Allow), possibly including extensions not defined by
   this specification. The response body, if any, SHOULD also include
   information about the communication options. The format for such a 

   body is not defined by this specification, but might be defined by
   future extensions to HTTP. Content negotiation MAY be used to select
   the appropriate response format. If no response body is included, the
   response MUST include a Content-Length field with a field-value of
   &quot;0&quot;.

   The Max-Forwards request-header field MAY be used to target a
   specific proxy in the request chain. When a proxy receives an OPTIONS
   request on an absoluteURI for which request forwarding is permitted,
   the proxy MUST check for a Max-Forwards field. If the Max-Forwards
   field-value is zero (&quot;0&quot;), the proxy MUST NOT forward the message;
   instead, the proxy SHOULD respond with its own communication options.
   If the Max-Forwards field-value is an integer greater than zero, the
   proxy MUST decrement the field-value when it forwards the request. If
   no Max-Forwards field is present in the request, then the forwarded
   request MUST NOT include a Max-Forwards field.</source>

          <source>The OPTIONS method requests information about the communication
   options available for the target resource, at either the origin
   server or an intervening intermediary.  This method allows a client
   to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a
   resource, or the capabilities of a server, without implying a
   resource action. 

   An OPTIONS request with an asterisk (&quot;*&quot;) as the request-target
   (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.3&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;5.3 of [RFC7230]&lt;/a&gt;) applies to the server in general rather
   than to a specific resource.  Since a server's communication options
   typically depend on the resource, the &quot;*&quot; request is only useful as a

   be used to test a proxy for HTTP/1.1 conformance (or lack thereof).

   If the request-target is not an asterisk, the OPTIONS request applies
   to the options that are available when communicating with the target
   resource.

   A server generating a successful response to OPTIONS SHOULD send any
   header fields that might indicate optional features implemented by
   the server and applicable to the target resource (e.g., Allow),
   including potential extensions not defined by this specification.
   The response payload, if any, might also describe the communication
   options in a machine or human-readable representation.  A standard
   format for such a representation is not defined by this
   specification, but might be defined by future extensions to HTTP.  A
   server MUST generate a Content-Length field with a value of &quot;0&quot; if no
   payload body is to be sent in the response.

   A client MAY send a Max-Forwards header field in an OPTIONS request
   to target a specific recipient in the request chain (see
   &lt;a href=&quot;#section-5.1.2&quot;&gt;Section 5.1.2&lt;/a&gt;).  A proxy MUST NOT generate a Max-Forwards header
   field while forwarding a request unless that request was received
   with a Max-Forwards field.

   A client that generates an OPTIONS request containing a payload body
   MUST send a valid Content-Type header field describing the
   representation media type.  Although this specification does not
   define any use for such a payload, future extensions to HTTP might
   use the OPTIONS body to make more detailed queries about the target
   resource.

          <source>The POST method is used to request that the origin server accept the
   entity enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the resource
   identified by the Request-URI in the Request-Line. POST is designed
   to allow a uniform method to cover the following functions:

      - Annotation of existing resources;

      - Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list,
        or similar group of articles;

      - Providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a
        form, to a data-handling process;

      - Extending a database through an append operation.

   The actual function performed by the POST method is determined by the
   server and is usually dependent on the Request-URI. The posted entity
   is subordinate to that URI in the same way that a file is subordinate
   to a directory containing it, a news article is subordinate to a
   newsgroup to which it is posted, or a record is subordinate to a
   database.

   The action performed by the POST method might not result in a
   resource that can be identified by a URI. In this case, either 200
   (OK) or 204 (No Content) is the appropriate response status,
   depending on whether or not the response includes an entity that
   describes the result. 

   If a resource has been created on the origin server, the response
   SHOULD be 201 (Created) and contain an entity which describes the
   status of the request and refers to the new resource, and a Location
   header (see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.30&quot;&gt;section 14.30&lt;/a&gt;).

   Responses to this method are not cacheable, unless the response
   includes appropriate Cache-Control or Expires header fields. However,
   the 303 (See Other) response can be used to direct the user agent to
   retrieve a cacheable resource.

   POST requests MUST obey the message transmission requirements set out
   in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-8.2&quot;&gt;section 8.2&lt;/a&gt;.

          <source>The POST method requests that the target resource process the
   representation enclosed in the request according to the resource's
   own specific semantics.  For example, POST is used for the following
   functions (among others):

   o  Providing a block of data, such as the fields entered into an HTML
      form, to a data-handling process; 

   o  Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list,
      blog, or similar group of articles;

   o  Creating a new resource that has yet to be identified by the
      origin server; and

   o  Appending data to a resource's existing representation(s).

   An origin server indicates response semantics by choosing an
   appropriate status code depending on the result of processing the
   POST request; almost all of the status codes defined by this
   specification might be received in a response to POST (the exceptions
   being 206 (Partial Content), 304 (Not Modified), and 416 (Range Not
   Satisfiable)).

   If one or more resources has been created on the origin server as a
   result of successfully processing a POST request, the origin server
   SHOULD send a 201 (Created) response containing a Location header
   field that provides an identifier for the primary resource created
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-7.1.2&quot;&gt;Section 7.1.2&lt;/a&gt;) and a representation that describes the status of the
   request while referring to the new resource(s).

   Responses to POST requests are only cacheable when they include
   explicit freshness information (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.2.1&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;4.2.1 of [RFC7234]&lt;/a&gt;).
   However, POST caching is not widely implemented.  For cases where an
   origin server wishes the client to be able to cache the result of a
   POST in a way that can be reused by a later GET, the origin server
   MAY send a 200 (OK) response containing the result and a
   Content-Location header field that has the same value as the POST's
   effective request URI (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.1.4.2&quot;&gt;Section 3.1.4.2&lt;/a&gt;).

   If the result of processing a POST would be equivalent to a
   representation of an existing resource, an origin server MAY redirect
   the user agent to that resource by sending a 303 (See Other) response
   with the existing resource's identifier in the Location field.  This
   has the benefits of providing the user agent a resource identifier
   and transferring the representation via a method more amenable to
   shared caching, though at the cost of an extra request if the user
   agent does not already have the representation cached.</source>

          <source>The PROPFIND method retrieves properties defined on the resource
   identified by the Request-URI, if the resource does not have any
   internal members, or on the resource identified by the Request-URI
   and potentially its member resources, if the resource is a collection
   that has internal member URLs.  All DAV-compliant resources MUST
   support the PROPFIND method and the propfind XML element
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.20&quot;&gt;Section 14.20&lt;/a&gt;) along with all XML elements defined for use with that
   element.

   A client MUST submit a Depth header with a value of &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, or
   &quot;infinity&quot; with a PROPFIND request.  Servers MUST support &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;
   depth requests on WebDAV-compliant resources and SHOULD support
   &quot;infinity&quot; requests.  In practice, support for infinite-depth
   requests MAY be disabled, due to the performance and security
   concerns associated with this behavior.  Servers SHOULD treat a
   request without a Depth header as if a &quot;Depth: infinity&quot; header was
   included. 

   A client may submit a 'propfind' XML element in the body of the
   request method describing what information is being requested.  It is
   possible to:

   o  Request particular property values, by naming the properties
      desired within the 'prop' element (the ordering of properties in
      here MAY be ignored by the server),

   o  Request property values for those properties defined in this
      specification (at a minimum) plus dead properties, by using the
      'allprop' element (the 'include' element can be used with
      'allprop' to instruct the server to also include additional live
      properties that may not have been returned otherwise),

   o  Request a list of names of all the properties defined on the
      resource, by using the 'propname' element.

   A client may choose not to submit a request body.  An empty PROPFIND
   request body MUST be treated as if it were an 'allprop' request.

   Note that 'allprop' does not return values for all live properties.
   WebDAV servers increasingly have expensively-calculated or lengthy
   properties (see [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253&quot;&gt;RFC3253&lt;/a&gt;] and [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3744&quot;&gt;RFC3744&lt;/a&gt;]) and do not return all
   properties already.  Instead, WebDAV clients can use propname
   requests to discover what live properties exist, and request named
   properties when retrieving values.  For a live property defined
   elsewhere, that definition can specify whether or not that live
   property would be returned in 'allprop' requests.

   All servers MUST support returning a response of content type text/
   xml or application/xml that contains a multistatus XML element that
   describes the results of the attempts to retrieve the various
   properties.

   If there is an error retrieving a property, then a proper error
   result MUST be included in the response.  A request to retrieve the
   value of a property that does not exist is an error and MUST be noted
   with a 'response' XML element that contains a 404 (Not Found) status
   value.

   Consequently, the 'multistatus' XML element for a collection resource
   MUST include a 'response' XML element for each member URL of the
   collection, to whatever depth was requested.  It SHOULD NOT include
   any 'response' elements for resources that are not WebDAV-compliant.
   Each 'response' element MUST contain an 'href' element that contains
   the URL of the resource on which the properties in the prop XML
   element are defined.  Results for a PROPFIND on a collection resource
   are returned as a flat list whose order of entries is not 

   significant.  Note that a resource may have only one value for a
   property of a given name, so the property may only show up once in
   PROPFIND responses.

   Properties may be subject to access control.  In the case of
   'allprop' and 'propname' requests, if a principal does not have the
   right to know whether a particular property exists, then the property
   MAY be silently excluded from the response.

   Some PROPFIND results MAY be cached, with care, as there is no cache
   validation mechanism for most properties.  This method is both safe
   and idempotent (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-9.1&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;9.1 of [RFC2616]&lt;/a&gt;).</source>

   body to set and/or remove properties defined on the resource

   All DAV-compliant resources MUST support the PROPPATCH method and
   MUST process instructions that are specified using the
   propertyupdate, set, and remove XML elements.  Execution of the
   directives in this method is, of course, subject to access control
   constraints.  DAV-compliant resources SHOULD support the setting of
   arbitrary dead properties.

   The request message body of a PROPPATCH method MUST contain the
   propertyupdate XML element.

   Servers MUST process PROPPATCH instructions in document order (an
   exception to the normal rule that ordering is irrelevant).
   Instructions MUST either all be executed or none executed.  Thus, if
   any error occurs during processing, all executed instructions MUST be
   undone and a proper error result returned.  Instruction processing
   details can be found in the definition of the set and remove

          <source>The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the
   supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already
   existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a
   modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the
   Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is
   capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user
   agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI. If a
   new resource is created, the origin server MUST inform the user agent
   via the 201 (Created) response. If an existing resource is modified,
   either the 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content) response codes SHOULD be sent
   to indicate successful completion of the request. If the resource
   could not be created or modified with the Request-URI, an appropriate
   error response SHOULD be given that reflects the nature of the
   problem. The recipient of the entity MUST NOT ignore any Content-*
   (e.g. Content-Range) headers that it does not understand or implement
   and MUST return a 501 (Not Implemented) response in such cases.

   If the request passes through a cache and the Request-URI identifies
   one or more currently cached entities, those entries SHOULD be
   treated as stale. Responses to this method are not cacheable.

   The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT requests is
   reflected in the different meaning of the Request-URI. The URI in a
   POST request identifies the resource that will handle the enclosed
   entity. That resource might be a data-accepting process, a gateway to
   some other protocol, or a separate entity that accepts annotations.
   In contrast, the URI in a PUT request identifies the entity enclosed
   with the request -- the user agent knows what URI is intended and the
   server MUST NOT attempt to apply the request to some other resource.
   If the server desires that the request be applied to a different URI, 

   it MUST send a 301 (Moved Permanently) response; the user agent MAY
   then make its own decision regarding whether or not to redirect the
   request.

   A single resource MAY be identified by many different URIs. For
   example, an article might have a URI for identifying &quot;the current
   version&quot; which is separate from the URI identifying each particular
   version. In this case, a PUT request on a general URI might result in
   several other URIs being defined by the origin server.

   HTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT method affects the state of an
   origin server.

   PUT requests MUST obey the message transmission requirements set out
   in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-8.2&quot;&gt;section 8.2&lt;/a&gt;.

   Unless otherwise specified for a particular entity-header, the
   entity-headers in the PUT request SHOULD be applied to the resource
   created or modified by the PUT.</source>

          <source>The PUT method requests that the state of the target resource be
   created or replaced with the state defined by the representation
   enclosed in the request message payload.  A successful PUT of a given
   representation would suggest that a subsequent GET on that same
   target resource will result in an equivalent representation being
   sent in a 200 (OK) response.  However, there is no guarantee that 

   such a state change will be observable, since the target resource
   might be acted upon by other user agents in parallel, or might be
   subject to dynamic processing by the origin server, before any
   subsequent GET is received.  A successful response only implies that
   the user agent's intent was achieved at the time of its processing by
   the origin server.

   If the target resource does not have a current representation and the
   PUT successfully creates one, then the origin server MUST inform the
   user agent by sending a 201 (Created) response.  If the target
   resource does have a current representation and that representation
   is successfully modified in accordance with the state of the enclosed
   representation, then the origin server MUST send either a 200 (OK) or
   a 204 (No Content) response to indicate successful completion of the
   request.

   An origin server SHOULD ignore unrecognized header fields received in
   a PUT request (i.e., do not save them as part of the resource state).

   An origin server SHOULD verify that the PUT representation is
   consistent with any constraints the server has for the target
   resource that cannot or will not be changed by the PUT.  This is
   particularly important when the origin server uses internal
   configuration information related to the URI in order to set the
   values for representation metadata on GET responses.  When a PUT
   representation is inconsistent with the target resource, the origin
   server SHOULD either make them consistent, by transforming the
   representation or changing the resource configuration, or respond
   with an appropriate error message containing sufficient information
   to explain why the representation is unsuitable.  The 409 (Conflict)
   or 415 (Unsupported Media Type) status codes are suggested, with the
   latter being specific to constraints on Content-Type values.

   For example, if the target resource is configured to always have a
   Content-Type of &quot;text/html&quot; and the representation being PUT has a
   Content-Type of &quot;image/jpeg&quot;, the origin server ought to do one of:

   a.  reconfigure the target resource to reflect the new media type;

   b.  transform the PUT representation to a format consistent with that
       of the resource before saving it as the new resource state; or,

   c.  reject the request with a 415 (Unsupported Media Type) response
       indicating that the target resource is limited to &quot;text/html&quot;,
       perhaps including a link to a different resource that would be a
       suitable target for the new representation. 

   HTTP does not define exactly how a PUT method affects the state of an
   origin server beyond what can be expressed by the intent of the user
   agent request and the semantics of the origin server response.  It
   does not define what a resource might be, in any sense of that word,
   beyond the interface provided via HTTP.  It does not define how
   resource state is &quot;stored&quot;, nor how such storage might change as a
   result of a change in resource state, nor how the origin server
   translates resource state into representations.  Generally speaking,
   all implementation details behind the resource interface are
   intentionally hidden by the server.

   An origin server MUST NOT send a validator header field
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-7.2&quot;&gt;Section 7.2&lt;/a&gt;), such as an ETag or Last-Modified field, in a
   successful response to PUT unless the request's representation data
   was saved without any transformation applied to the body (i.e., the
   resource's new representation data is identical to the representation
   data received in the PUT request) and the validator field value
   reflects the new representation.  This requirement allows a user
   agent to know when the representation body it has in memory remains
   current as a result of the PUT, thus not in need of being retrieved
   again from the origin server, and that the new validator(s) received
   in the response can be used for future conditional requests in order
   to prevent accidental overwrites (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-5.2&quot;&gt;Section 5.2&lt;/a&gt;).

   The fundamental difference between the POST and PUT methods is
   highlighted by the different intent for the enclosed representation.
   The target resource in a POST request is intended to handle the
   enclosed representation according to the resource's own semantics,
   whereas the enclosed representation in a PUT request is defined as
   replacing the state of the target resource.  Hence, the intent of PUT
   is idempotent and visible to intermediaries, even though the exact
   effect is only known by the origin server.

   Proper interpretation of a PUT request presumes that the user agent
   knows which target resource is desired.  A service that selects a
   proper URI on behalf of the client, after receiving a state-changing
   request, SHOULD be implemented using the POST method rather than PUT.
   If the origin server will not make the requested PUT state change to
   the target resource and instead wishes to have it applied to a
   different resource, such as when the resource has been moved to a
   different URI, then the origin server MUST send an appropriate 3xx
   (Redirection) response; the user agent MAY then make its own decision
   regarding whether or not to redirect the request.

   A PUT request applied to the target resource can have side effects on
   other resources.  For example, an article might have a URI for
   identifying &quot;the current version&quot; (a resource) that is separate from
   the URIs identifying each particular version (different resources 

   that at one point shared the same state as the current version
   resource).  A successful PUT request on &quot;the current version&quot; URI
   might therefore create a new version resource in addition to changing
   the state of the target resource, and might also cause links to be
   added between the related resources.

   An origin server that allows PUT on a given target resource MUST send
   a 400 (Bad Request) response to a PUT request that contains a
   Content-Range header field (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233#section-4.2&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;4.2 of [RFC7233]&lt;/a&gt;), since the
   payload is likely to be partial content that has been mistakenly PUT
   as a full representation.  Partial content updates are possible by
   targeting a separately identified resource with state that overlaps a
   portion of the larger resource, or by using a different method that
   has been specifically defined for partial updates (for example, the
   PATCH method defined in [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789&quot;&gt;RFC5789&lt;/a&gt;]).

   Responses to the PUT method are not cacheable.  If a successful PUT
   request passes through a cache that has one or more stored responses
   for the effective request URI, those stored responses will be
   invalidated (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-4.4&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;4.4 of [RFC7234]&lt;/a&gt;).</source>

          <source>The Pragma general-header field is used to include implementation-
   specific directives that might apply to any recipient along the
   request/response chain. All pragma directives specify optional
   behavior from the viewpoint of the protocol; however, some systems
   MAY require that behavior be consistent with the directives.

       Pragma            = &quot;Pragma&quot; &quot;:&quot; 1#pragma-directive
       pragma-directive  = &quot;no-cache&quot; | extension-pragma
       extension-pragma  = token [ &quot;=&quot; ( token | quoted-string ) ]

   When the no-cache directive is present in a request message, an
   application SHOULD forward the request toward the origin server even
   if it has a cached copy of what is being requested. This pragma
   directive has the same semantics as the no-cache cache-directive (see
   &lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.9&quot;&gt;section 14.9&lt;/a&gt;) and is defined here for backward compatibility with
   HTTP/1.0. Clients SHOULD include both header fields when a no-cache
   request is sent to a server not known to be HTTP/1.1 compliant. 

   Pragma directives MUST be passed through by a proxy or gateway
   application, regardless of their significance to that application,
   since the directives might be applicable to all recipients along the
   request/response chain. It is not possible to specify a pragma for a
   specific recipient; however, any pragma directive not relevant to a
   recipient SHOULD be ignored by that recipient.

   HTTP/1.1 caches SHOULD treat &quot;Pragma: no-cache&quot; as if the client had
   sent &quot;Cache-Control: no-cache&quot;. No new Pragma directives will be
   defined in HTTP.

      Note: because the meaning of &quot;Pragma: no-cache as a response
      header field is not actually specified, it does not provide a
      reliable replacement for &quot;Cache-Control: no-cache&quot; in a response</source>

   identifies the resource upon which to apply the request.

       Request-URI    = &quot;*&quot; | absoluteURI | abs_path | authority

   The four options for Request-URI are dependent on the nature of the
   request. The asterisk &quot;*&quot; means that the request does not apply to a
   particular resource, but to the server itself, and is only allowed
   when the method used does not necessarily apply to a resource. One
   example would be

       OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1

   The absoluteURI form is REQUIRED when the request is being made to a
   proxy. The proxy is requested to forward the request or service it
   from a valid cache, and return the response. Note that the proxy MAY
   forward the request on to another proxy or directly to the server 

   specified by the absoluteURI. In order to avoid request loops, a
   proxy MUST be able to recognize all of its server names, including
   any aliases, local variations, and the numeric IP address. An example
   Request-Line would be:

       GET &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TheProject.html&quot;&gt;http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/TheProject.html&lt;/a&gt; HTTP/1.1

   To allow for transition to absoluteURIs in all requests in future
   versions of HTTP, all HTTP/1.1 servers MUST accept the absoluteURI
   form in requests, even though HTTP/1.1 clients will only generate
   them in requests to proxies.

   The authority form is only used by the CONNECT method (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-9.9&quot;&gt;section 9.9&lt;/a&gt;).

   The most common form of Request-URI is that used to identify a
   resource on an origin server or gateway. In this case the absolute
   path of the URI MUST be transmitted (see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.2.1&quot;&gt;section 3.2.1&lt;/a&gt;, abs_path) as
   the Request-URI, and the network location of the URI (authority) MUST
   be transmitted in a Host header field. For example, a client wishing
   to retrieve the resource above directly from the origin server would
   create a TCP connection to port 80 of the host &quot;www.w3.org&quot; and send
   the lines:

       GET /pub/WWW/TheProject.html HTTP/1.1
       Host: www.w3.org

   followed by the remainder of the Request. Note that the absolute path
   cannot be empty; if none is present in the original URI, it MUST be
   given as &quot;/&quot; (the server root).

   The Request-URI is transmitted in the format specified in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.2.1&quot;&gt;section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.2.1&quot;&gt;3.2.1&lt;/a&gt;. If the Request-URI is encoded using the &quot;% HEX HEX&quot; encoding
   [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-42&quot;&gt;42&lt;/a&gt;], the origin server MUST decode the Request-URI in order to
   properly interpret the request. Servers SHOULD respond to invalid
   Request-URIs with an appropriate status code.

   A transparent proxy MUST NOT rewrite the &quot;abs_path&quot; part of the
   received Request-URI when forwarding it to the next inbound server,
   except as noted above to replace a null abs_path with &quot;/&quot;.

      Note: The &quot;no rewrite&quot; rule prevents the proxy from changing the
      meaning of the request when the origin server is improperly using
      a non-reserved URI character for a reserved purpose.  Implementors
      should be aware that some pre-HTTP/1.1 proxies have been known to
      rewrite the Request-URI.</source>

   HTTP status codes are extensible. HTTP applications are not required
   to understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such
   understanding is obviously desirable. However, applications MUST
   understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first
   digit, and treat any unrecognized response as being equivalent to the
   x00 status code of that class, with the exception that an
   unrecognized response MUST NOT be cached. For example, if an
   unrecognized status code of 431 is received by the client, it can
   safely assume that there was something wrong with its request and
   treat the response as if it had received a 400 status code. In such
   cases, user agents SHOULD present to the user the entity returned
   with the response, since that entity is likely to include human-
   readable information which will explain the unusual status.</source>

          <source>The TE request-header field indicates what extension transfer-codings
   it is willing to accept in the response and whether or not it is
   willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked transfer-coding. Its
   value may consist of the keyword &quot;trailers&quot; and/or a comma-separated
   list of extension transfer-coding names with optional accept
   parameters (as described in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.6&quot;&gt;section 3.6&lt;/a&gt;).

       TE        = &quot;TE&quot; &quot;:&quot; #( t-codings )
       t-codings = &quot;trailers&quot; | ( transfer-extension [ accept-params ] )

   The presence of the keyword &quot;trailers&quot; indicates that the client is
   willing to accept trailer fields in a chunked transfer-coding, as
   defined in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.6.1&quot;&gt;section 3.6.1&lt;/a&gt;. This keyword is reserved for use with
   transfer-coding values even though it does not itself represent a
   transfer-coding.

   Examples of its use are:

       TE: deflate
       TE:
       TE: trailers, deflate;q=0.5

   The TE header field only applies to the immediate connection.
   Therefore, the keyword MUST be supplied within a Connection header
   field (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.10&quot;&gt;section 14.10&lt;/a&gt;) whenever TE is present in an HTTP/1.1 message.

   A server tests whether a transfer-coding is acceptable, according to
   a TE field, using these rules:

      1. The &quot;chunked&quot; transfer-coding is always acceptable. If the
         keyword &quot;trailers&quot; is listed, the client indicates that it is
         willing to accept trailer fields in the chunked response on
         behalf of itself and any downstream clients. The implication is
         that, if given, the client is stating that either all
         downstream clients are willing to accept trailer fields in the
         forwarded response, or that it will attempt to buffer the
         response on behalf of downstream recipients.

         Note: HTTP/1.1 does not define any means to limit the size of a
         chunked response such that a client can be assured of buffering
         the entire response.

      2. If the transfer-coding being tested is one of the transfer-
         codings listed in the TE field, then it is acceptable unless it
         is accompanied by a qvalue of 0. (As defined in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.9&quot;&gt;section 3.9&lt;/a&gt;, a
         qvalue of 0 means &quot;not acceptable.&quot;) 

      3. If multiple transfer-codings are acceptable, then the
         acceptable transfer-coding with the highest non-zero qvalue is
         preferred.  The &quot;chunked&quot; transfer-coding always has a qvalue
         of 1.

   If the TE field-value is empty or if no TE field is present, the only
   transfer-coding  is &quot;chunked&quot;. A message with no transfer-coding is
   always acceptable.</source>

          <source>The Transfer-Encoding header field lists the transfer coding names
   corresponding to the sequence of transfer codings that have been (or

   body.  Transfer codings are defined in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-4&quot;&gt;Section 4&lt;/a&gt;.

     Transfer-Encoding = 1#transfer-coding

   Transfer-Encoding is analogous to the Content-Transfer-Encoding field
   of MIME, which was designed to enable safe transport of binary data
   over a 7-bit transport service (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2045#section-6&quot;&gt;[RFC2045], Section&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/a&gt;).  However, safe
   transport has a different focus for an 8bit-clean transfer protocol.
   In HTTP's case, Transfer-Encoding is primarily intended to accurately
   delimit a dynamically generated payload and to distinguish payload
   encodings that are only applied for transport efficiency or security
   from those that are characteristics of the selected resource. 

   A recipient MUST be able to parse the chunked transfer coding
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-4.1&quot;&gt;Section 4.1&lt;/a&gt;) because it plays a crucial role in framing messages
   when the payload body size is not known in advance.  A sender MUST
   NOT apply chunked more than once to a message body (i.e., chunking an
   already chunked message is not allowed).  If any transfer coding
   other than chunked is applied to a request payload body, the sender
   MUST apply chunked as the final transfer coding to ensure that the
   message is properly framed.  If any transfer coding other than
   chunked is applied to a response payload body, the sender MUST either
   apply chunked as the final transfer coding or terminate the message
   by closing the connection.

   For example,

     Transfer-Encoding: gzip, chunked

   indicates that the payload body has been compressed using the gzip
   coding and then chunked using the chunked coding while forming the
   message body.

   Unlike Content-Encoding (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-3.1.2.1&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;3.1.2.1 of [RFC7231]&lt;/a&gt;),
   Transfer-Encoding is a property of the message, not of the
   representation, and any recipient along the request/response chain
   MAY decode the received transfer coding(s) or apply additional
   transfer coding(s) to the message body, assuming that corresponding
   changes are made to the Transfer-Encoding field-value.  Additional
   information about the encoding parameters can be provided by other
   header fields not defined by this specification.

   Transfer-Encoding MAY be sent in a response to a HEAD request or in a
   304 (Not Modified) response (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232#section-4.1&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;4.1 of [RFC7232]&lt;/a&gt;) to a GET
   request, neither of which includes a message body, to indicate that
   the origin server would have applied a transfer coding to the message
   body if the request had been an unconditional GET.  This indication
   is not required, however, because any recipient on the response chain
   (including the origin server) can remove transfer codings when they
   are not needed.

   A server MUST NOT send a Transfer-Encoding header field in any
   response with a status code of 1xx (Informational) or 204 (No
   Content).  A server MUST NOT send a Transfer-Encoding header field in
   any 2xx (Successful) response to a CONNECT request (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.6&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;4.3.6 of
   [RFC7231]&lt;/a&gt;).

   Transfer-Encoding was added in HTTP/1.1.  It is generally assumed
   that implementations advertising only HTTP/1.0 support will not
   understand how to process a transfer-encoded payload.  A client MUST
   NOT send a request containing Transfer-Encoding unless it knows the 

   server will handle HTTP/1.1 (or later) requests; such knowledge might
   be in the form of specific user configuration or by remembering the
   version of a prior received response.  A server MUST NOT send a
   response containing Transfer-Encoding unless the corresponding
   request indicates HTTP/1.1 (or later).

   A server that receives a request message with a transfer coding it
   does not understand SHOULD respond with 501 (Not Implemented).</source>

          <source>The Upgrade general-header allows the client to specify what
   additional communication protocols it supports and would like to use
   if the server finds it appropriate to switch protocols. The server
   MUST use the Upgrade header field within a 101 (Switching Protocols)
   response to indicate which protocol(s) are being switched.

       Upgrade        = &quot;Upgrade&quot; &quot;:&quot; 1#product

   For example,

       Upgrade: HTTP/2.0, SHTTP/1.3, IRC/6.9, RTA/x11

   The Upgrade header field is intended to provide a simple mechanism
   for transition from HTTP/1.1 to some other, incompatible protocol. It
   does so by allowing the client to advertise its desire to use another
   protocol, such as a later version of HTTP with a higher major version
   number, even though the current request has been made using HTTP/1.1.
   This eases the difficult transition between incompatible protocols by
   allowing the client to initiate a request in the more commonly
   supported protocol while indicating to the server that it would like
   to use a &quot;better&quot; protocol if available (where &quot;better&quot; is determined
   by the server, possibly according to the nature of the method and/or
   resource being requested).

   The Upgrade header field only applies to switching application-layer
   protocols upon the existing transport-layer connection. Upgrade
   cannot be used to insist on a protocol change; its acceptance and use
   by the server is optional. The capabilities and nature of the
   application-layer communication after the protocol change is entirely
   dependent upon the new protocol chosen, although the first action
   after changing the protocol MUST be a response to the initial HTTP
   request containing the Upgrade header field.

   The Upgrade header field only applies to the immediate connection.
   Therefore, the upgrade keyword MUST be supplied within a Connection
   header field (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.10&quot;&gt;section 14.10&lt;/a&gt;) whenever Upgrade is present in an
   HTTP/1.1 message. 

   The Upgrade header field cannot be used to indicate a switch to a
   protocol on a different connection. For that purpose, it is more
   appropriate to use a 301, 302, 303, or 305 redirection response.

   This specification only defines the protocol name &quot;HTTP&quot; for use by
   the family of Hypertext Transfer Protocols, as defined by the HTTP
   version rules of &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.1&quot;&gt;section 3.1&lt;/a&gt; and future updates to this
   specification. Any token can be used as a protocol name; however, it
   will only be useful if both the client and server associate the name
   with the same protocol.</source>

          <source>The Vary field value indicates the set of request-header fields that
   fully determines, while the response is fresh, whether a cache is
   permitted to use the response to reply to a subsequent request
   without revalidation. For uncacheable or stale responses, the Vary
   field value advises the user agent about the criteria that were used
   to select the representation. A Vary field value of &quot;*&quot; implies that
   a cache cannot determine from the request headers of a subsequent
   request whether this response is the appropriate representation. See
   &lt;a href=&quot;#section-13.6&quot;&gt;section 13.6&lt;/a&gt; for use of the Vary header field by caches.

       Vary  = &quot;Vary&quot; &quot;:&quot; ( &quot;*&quot; | 1#field-name )

   An HTTP/1.1 server SHOULD include a Vary header field with any
   cacheable response that is subject to server-driven negotiation.
   Doing so allows a cache to properly interpret future requests on that
   resource and informs the user agent about the presence of negotiation 

   on that resource. A server MAY include a Vary header field with a
   non-cacheable response that is subject to server-driven negotiation,
   since this might provide the user agent with useful information about
   the dimensions over which the response varies at the time of the
   response.

   A Vary field value consisting of a list of field-names signals that
   the representation selected for the response is based on a selection
   algorithm which considers ONLY the listed request-header field values
   in selecting the most appropriate representation. A cache MAY assume
   that the same selection will be made for future requests with the
   same values for the listed field names, for the duration of time for
   which the response is fresh.

   The field-names given are not limited to the set of standard
   request-header fields defined by this specification. Field names are
   case-insensitive.

   A Vary field value of &quot;*&quot; signals that unspecified parameters not
   limited to the request-headers (e.g., the network address of the
   client), play a role in the selection of the response representation.
   The &quot;*&quot; value MUST NOT be generated by a proxy server; it may only be
   generated by an origin server.</source>

          <source>The Via general-header field MUST be used by gateways and proxies to
   indicate the intermediate protocols and recipients between the user
   agent and the server on requests, and between the origin server and
   the client on responses. It is analogous to the &quot;Received&quot; field of
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822&quot;&gt;RFC 822&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;] and is intended to be used for tracking message forwards,
   avoiding request loops, and identifying the protocol capabilities of
   all senders along the request/response chain.

      Via =  &quot;Via&quot; &quot;:&quot; 1#( received-protocol received-by [ comment ] )
      received-protocol = [ protocol-name &quot;/&quot; ] protocol-version
      protocol-name     = token
      protocol-version  = token
      received-by       = ( host [ &quot;:&quot; port ] ) | pseudonym
      pseudonym         = token

   The received-protocol indicates the protocol version of the message
   received by the server or client along each segment of the
   request/response chain. The received-protocol version is appended to
   the Via field value when the message is forwarded so that information
   about the protocol capabilities of upstream applications remains
   visible to all recipients. 

   The protocol-name is optional if and only if it would be &quot;HTTP&quot;. The
   received-by field is normally the host and optional port number of a
   recipient server or client that subsequently forwarded the message.
   However, if the real host is considered to be sensitive information,
   it MAY be replaced by a pseudonym. If the port is not given, it MAY
   be assumed to be the default port of the received-protocol.

   Multiple Via field values represents each proxy or gateway that has
   forwarded the message. Each recipient MUST append its information
   such that the end result is ordered according to the sequence of
   forwarding applications.

   Comments MAY be used in the Via header field to identify the software
   of the recipient proxy or gateway, analogous to the User-Agent and
   Server header fields. However, all comments in the Via field are
   optional and MAY be removed by any recipient prior to forwarding the
   message.

   For example, a request message could be sent from an HTTP/1.0 user
   agent to an internal proxy code-named &quot;fred&quot;, which uses HTTP/1.1 to
   forward the request to a public proxy at nowhere.com, which completes
   the request by forwarding it to the origin server at www.ics.uci.edu.
   The request received by www.ics.uci.edu would then have the following
   Via header field:

       Via: 1.0 fred, 1.1 nowhere.com (Apache/1.1)

   Proxies and gateways used as a portal through a network firewall
   SHOULD NOT, by default, forward the names and ports of hosts within
   the firewall region. This information SHOULD only be propagated if
   explicitly enabled. If not enabled, the received-by host of any host
   behind the firewall SHOULD be replaced by an appropriate pseudonym
   for that host.

   For organizations that have strong privacy requirements for hiding
   internal structures, a proxy MAY combine an ordered subsequence of
   Via header field entries with identical received-protocol values into
   a single such entry. For example,

       Via: 1.0 ricky, 1.1 ethel, 1.1 fred, 1.0 lucy

        could be collapsed to

       Via: 1.0 ricky, 1.1 mertz, 1.0 lucy 

   Applications SHOULD NOT combine multiple entries unless they are all
   under the same organizational control and the hosts have already been
   replaced by pseudonyms. Applications MUST NOT combine entries which
   have different received-protocol values.</source>

          <source>The Warning general-header field is used to carry additional
   information about the status or transformation of a message which
   might not be reflected in the message. This information is typically
   used to warn about a possible lack of semantic transparency from
   caching operations or transformations applied to the entity body of
   the message.

   Warning headers are sent with responses using:

       Warning    = &quot;Warning&quot; &quot;:&quot; 1#warning-value

       warning-value = warn-code SP warn-agent SP warn-text
                                             [SP warn-date]

       warn-code  = 3DIGIT
       warn-agent = ( host [ &quot;:&quot; port ] ) | pseudonym
                       ; the name or pseudonym of the server adding
                       ; the Warning header, for use in debugging
       warn-text  = quoted-string
       warn-date  = &amp;lt;&quot;&amp;gt; HTTP-date &amp;lt;&quot;&amp;gt;

   A response MAY carry more than one Warning header.

   The warn-text SHOULD be in a natural language and character set that
   is most likely to be intelligible to the human user receiving the
   response. This decision MAY be based on any available knowledge, such
   as the location of the cache or user, the Accept-Language field in a
   request, the Content-Language field in a response, etc. The default
   language is English and the default character set is ISO-8859-1.

   If a character set other than ISO-8859-1 is used, it MUST be encoded
   in the warn-text using the method described in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047&quot;&gt;RFC 2047&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;].

   Warning headers can in general be applied to any message, however
   some specific warn-codes are specific to caches and can only be
   applied to response messages. New Warning headers SHOULD be added
   after any existing Warning headers. A cache MUST NOT delete any
   Warning header that it received with a message. However, if a cache
   successfully validates a cache entry, it SHOULD remove any Warning
   headers previously attached to that entry except as specified for 

   specific Warning codes. It MUST then add any Warning headers received
   in the validating response. In other words, Warning headers are those
   that would be attached to the most recent relevant response.

   When multiple Warning headers are attached to a response, the user
   agent ought to inform the user of as many of them as possible, in the
   order that they appear in the response. If it is not possible to
   inform the user of all of the warnings, the user agent SHOULD follow
   these heuristics:

      - Warnings that appear early in the response take priority over
        those appearing later in the response.

      - Warnings in the user's preferred character set take priority
        over warnings in other character sets but with identical warn-
        codes and warn-agents.

   Systems that generate multiple Warning headers SHOULD order them with
   this user agent behavior in mind.

   Requirements for the behavior of caches with respect to Warnings are
   stated in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-13.1.2&quot;&gt;section 13.1.2&lt;/a&gt;.

   This is a list of the currently-defined warn-codes, each with a
   recommended warn-text in English, and a description of its meaning.

   110 Response is stale
     MUST be included whenever the returned response is stale.

   111 Revalidation failed
     MUST be included if a cache returns a stale response because an
     attempt to revalidate the response failed, due to an inability to
     reach the server.

   112 Disconnected operation
     SHOULD be included if the cache is intentionally disconnected from
     the rest of the network for a period of time.

   113 Heuristic expiration
     MUST be included if the cache heuristically chose a freshness
     lifetime greater than 24 hours and the response's age is greater
     than 24 hours.

   199 Miscellaneous warning
     The warning text MAY include arbitrary information to be presented
     to a human user, or logged. A system receiving this warning MUST
     NOT take any automated action, besides presenting the warning to
     the user. 

   214 Transformation applied
     MUST be added by an intermediate cache or proxy if it applies any
     transformation changing the content-coding (as specified in the
     Content-Encoding header) or media-type (as specified in the
     Content-Type header) of the response, or the entity-body of the
     response, unless this Warning code already appears in the response.

   299 Miscellaneous persistent warning
     The warning text MAY include arbitrary information to be presented
     to a human user, or logged. A system receiving this warning MUST
     NOT take any automated action.

   If an implementation sends a message with one or more Warning headers
   whose version is HTTP/1.0 or lower, then the sender MUST include in
   each warning-value a warn-date that matches the date in the response.

   If an implementation receives a message with a warning-value that
   includes a warn-date, and that warn-date is different from the Date
   value in the response, then that warning-value MUST be deleted from
   the message before storing, forwarding, or using it. (This prevents
   bad consequences of naive caching of Warning header fields.) If all
   of the warning-values are deleted for this reason, the Warning header
   MUST be deleted as well.</source>

          <source>The XML namespace extension ([&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-REC-XML-NAMES&quot;&gt;REC-XML-NAMES&lt;/a&gt;]) is used in this
   specification in order to allow for new XML elements to be added
   without fear of colliding with other element names.  Although WebDAV
   request and response bodies can be extended by arbitrary XML
   elements, which can be ignored by the message recipient, an XML
   element in the &quot;DAV:&quot; namespace SHOULD NOT be used in the request or
   response body unless that XML element is explicitly defined in an
   IETF RFC reviewed by a WebDAV working group.

   For WebDAV to be both extensible and backwards-compatible, both
   clients and servers need to know how to behave when unexpected or
   unrecognized command extensions are received.  For XML processing,
   this means that clients and servers MUST process received XML
   documents as if unexpected elements and attributes (and all children
   of unrecognized elements) were not there.  An unexpected element or
   attribute includes one that may be used in another context but is not
   expected here.  Ignoring such items for purposes of processing can of
   course be consistent with logging all information or presenting for
   debugging.

   This restriction also applies to the processing, by clients, of DAV
   property values where unexpected XML elements SHOULD be ignored
   unless the property's schema declares otherwise.

   This restriction does not apply to setting dead DAV properties on the
   server where the server MUST record all XML elements. 

   Additionally, this restriction does not apply to the use of XML where
   XML happens to be the content type of the entity body, for example,
   when used as the body of a PUT.

   Processing instructions in XML SHOULD be ignored by recipients.
   Thus, specifications extending WebDAV SHOULD NOT use processing
   instructions to define normative behavior.

   XML DTD fragments are included for all the XML elements defined in
   this specification.  However, correct XML will not be valid according
   to any DTD due to namespace usage and extension rules.  In
   particular:

   o  Elements (from this specification) are in the &quot;DAV:&quot; namespace,

   o  Element ordering is irrelevant unless otherwise stated,

   o  Extension attributes MAY be added,

   o  For element type definitions of &quot;ANY&quot;, the normative text
      definition for that element defines what can be in it and what
      that means.

   o  For element type definitions of &quot;#PCDATA&quot;, extension elements MUST
      NOT be added.

   o  For other element type definitions, including &quot;EMPTY&quot;, extension
      elements MAY be added.

   Note that this means that elements containing elements cannot be
   extended to contain text, and vice versa.

   With DTD validation relaxed by the rules above, the constraints
   described by the DTD fragments are normative (see for example
   &lt;a href=&quot;#appendix-A&quot;&gt;Appendix A&lt;/a&gt;).  A recipient of a WebDAV message with an XML body MUST
   NOT validate the XML document according to any hard-coded or
   dynamically-declared DTD.

   Note that this section describes backwards-compatible extensibility
   rules.  There might also be times when an extension is designed not
   to be backwards-compatible, for example, defining an extension that
   reuses an XML element defined in this document but omitting one of
   the child elements required by the DTDs in this specification.</source>

          <source>The basic cache mechanisms in HTTP/1.1 (server-specified expiration
   times and validators) are implicit directives to caches. In some
   cases, a server or client might need to provide explicit directives
   to the HTTP caches. We use the Cache-Control header for this purpose.

   The Cache-Control header allows a client or server to transmit a
   variety of directives in either requests or responses. These
   directives typically override the default caching algorithms. As a
   general rule, if there is any apparent conflict between header
   values, the most restrictive interpretation is applied (that is, the
   one that is most likely to preserve semantic transparency). However, 

   in some cases, cache-control directives are explicitly specified as
   weakening the approximation of semantic transparency (for example,
   &quot;max-stale&quot; or &quot;public&quot;).

   The cache-control directives are described in detail in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.9&quot;&gt;section 14.9&lt;/a&gt;.</source>

          <source>The chunked encoding allows each chunk to include zero or more chunk
   extensions, immediately following the chunk-size, for the sake of
   supplying per-chunk metadata (such as a signature or hash),
   mid-message control information, or randomization of message body
   size.

     chunk-ext      = *( &quot;;&quot; chunk-ext-name [ &quot;=&quot; chunk-ext-val ] )

     chunk-ext-name = token
     chunk-ext-val  = token / quoted-string

   The chunked encoding is specific to each connection and is likely to
   be removed or recoded by each recipient (including intermediaries)
   before any higher-level application would have a chance to inspect
   the extensions.  Hence, use of chunk extensions is generally limited 

   to specialized HTTP services such as &quot;long polling&quot; (where client and
   server can have shared expectations regarding the use of chunk
   extensions) or for padding within an end-to-end secured connection.

   A recipient MUST ignore unrecognized chunk extensions.  A server
   ought to limit the total length of chunk extensions received in a
   request to an amount reasonable for the services provided, in the
   same way that it applies length limitations and timeouts for other
   parts of a message, and generate an appropriate 4xx (Client Error)
   response if that amount is exceeded.</source>

          <source>The chunked encoding modifies the body of a message in order to
   transfer it as a series of chunks, each with its own size indicator,
   followed by an OPTIONAL trailer containing entity-header fields. This
   allows dynamically produced content to be transferred along with the
   information necessary for the recipient to verify that it has
   received the full message.

       Chunked-Body   = *chunk
                        last-chunk
                        trailer

       chunk-data     = chunk-size(OCTET)
       trailer        = *(entity-header CRLF)

   The chunk-size field is a string of hex digits indicating the size of
   the chunk. The chunked encoding is ended by any chunk whose size is
   zero, followed by the trailer, which is terminated by an empty line.

   The trailer allows the sender to include additional HTTP header
   fields at the end of the message. The Trailer header field can be
   used to indicate which header fields are included in a trailer (see
   &lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.40&quot;&gt;section 14.40&lt;/a&gt;). 

   A server using chunked transfer-coding in a response MUST NOT use the
   trailer for any header fields unless at least one of the following is
   true:

   a)the request included a TE header field that indicates &quot;trailers&quot; is
     acceptable in the transfer-coding of the  response, as described in
     &lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.39&quot;&gt;section 14.39&lt;/a&gt;; or,

   b)the server is the origin server for the response, the trailer
     fields consist entirely of optional metadata, and the recipient
     could use the message (in a manner acceptable to the origin server)
     without receiving this metadata.  In other words, the origin server
     is willing to accept the possibility that the trailer fields might
     be silently discarded along the path to the client.

   This requirement prevents an interoperability failure when the
   message is being received by an HTTP/1.1 (or later) proxy and
   forwarded to an HTTP/1.0 recipient. It avoids a situation where
   compliance with the protocol would have necessitated a possibly
   infinite buffer on the proxy.

   An example process for decoding a Chunked-Body is presented in
   appendix 19.4.6.

   All HTTP/1.1 applications MUST be able to receive and decode the
   &quot;chunked&quot; transfer-coding, and MUST ignore chunk-extension extensions
   they do not understand.</source>

          <source>The chunked transfer coding wraps the payload body in order to
   transfer it as a series of chunks, each with its own size indicator,
   followed by an OPTIONAL trailer containing header fields.  Chunked
   enables content streams of unknown size to be transferred as a
   sequence of length-delimited buffers, which enables the sender to
   retain connection persistence and the recipient to know when it has
   received the entire message.

   defined in [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616&quot;&gt;RFC2616&lt;/a&gt;].  The media range specifies a type of
   representation that can be POSTed to a Collection.

   The app:accept element is similar to the HTTP Accept request-header
   [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616&quot;&gt;RFC2616&lt;/a&gt;].  Media type parameters are allowed within app:accept, but
   app:accept has no notion of preference -- &quot;accept-params&quot; or &quot;q&quot;
   arguments, as specified in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.1&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;14.1 of [RFC2616]&lt;/a&gt; are not
   significant.

   White space (as defined in [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-REC-xml&quot;&gt;REC-xml&lt;/a&gt;]) around the app:accept element's
   media range is insignificant and MUST be ignored.

   A value of &quot;application/atom+xml;type=entry&quot; MAY appear in any app:
   accept list of media ranges and indicates that Atom Entry Documents
   can be POSTed to the Collection.  If no app:accept element is
   present, clients SHOULD treat this as equivalent to an app:accept
   element with the content &quot;application/atom+xml;type=entry&quot;.

   If one app:accept element exists and is empty, clients SHOULD assume
   that the Collection does not support the creation of new Entries.

          <source>The definition of collection state has been fixed so it doesn't vary

   The DAV:source property introduced in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2518#section-4.6&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;4.6 of [RFC2518]&lt;/a&gt; was
   removed due to lack of implementation experience.

   The DAV header now allows non-IETF extensions through URIs in
   addition to compliance class tokens.  It also can now be used in
   requests, although this specification does not define any associated
   semantics for the compliance classes defined in here (see
   &lt;a href=&quot;#section-10.1&quot;&gt;Section 10.1&lt;/a&gt;).

   In &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2518&quot;&gt;RFC 2518&lt;/a&gt;, the definition of the Depth header (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-9.2&quot;&gt;Section 9.2&lt;/a&gt;)
   required that, by default, request headers would be applied to each
   resource in scope.  Based on implementation experience, the default
   has now been reversed (see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-10.2&quot;&gt;Section 10.2&lt;/a&gt;).

   The definitions of HTTP status code 102 (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2518#section-10.1&quot;&gt;[RFC2518], Section&amp;nbsp;10.1&lt;/a&gt;) and
   the Status-URI response header (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-9.7&quot;&gt;Section 9.7&lt;/a&gt;) have been removed due to
   lack of implementation.

   The TimeType format used in the Timeout request header and the
   &quot;timeout&quot; XML element used to be extensible.  Now, only the two
   formats defined by this specification are allowed (see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-10.7&quot;&gt;Section 10.7&lt;/a&gt;).

          <source>The delta-seconds rule specifies a non-negative integer, representing
   time in seconds.

     delta-seconds  = 1*DIGIT

   A recipient parsing a delta-seconds value and converting it to binary
   form ought to use an arithmetic type of at least 31 bits of
   non-negative integer range.  If a cache receives a delta-seconds
   value greater than the greatest integer it can represent, or if any
   of its subsequent calculations overflows, the cache MUST consider the
   value to be either 2147483648 (2^31) or the greatest positive integer
   it can conveniently represent.

      Note: The value 2147483648 is here for historical reasons,
      effectively represents infinity (over 68 years), and does not need
      to be stored in binary form; an implementation could produce it as
      a canned string if any overflow occurs, even if the calculations
      are performed with an arithmetic type incapable of directly
      representing that number.  What matters here is that an overflow
      be detected and not treated as a negative value in later
      calculations.</source>

          <source>The effect of certain methods performed on a resource at the origin
   server might cause one or more existing cache entries to become non-
   transparently invalid. That is, although they might continue to be
   &quot;fresh,&quot; they do not accurately reflect what the origin server would
   return for a new request on that resource. 

   There is no way for the HTTP protocol to guarantee that all such
   cache entries are marked invalid. For example, the request that
   caused the change at the origin server might not have gone through
   the proxy where a cache entry is stored. However, several rules help
   reduce the likelihood of erroneous behavior.

   In this section, the phrase &quot;invalidate an entity&quot; means that the
   cache will either remove all instances of that entity from its
   storage, or will mark these as &quot;invalid&quot; and in need of a mandatory
   revalidation before they can be returned in response to a subsequent
   request.

   Some HTTP methods MUST cause a cache to invalidate an entity. This is
   either the entity referred to by the Request-URI, or by the Location
   or Content-Location headers (if present). These methods are:

      - PUT

      - DELETE

      - POST

   In order to prevent denial of service attacks, an invalidation based
   on the URI in a Location or Content-Location header MUST only be
   performed if the host part is the same as in the Request-URI.

   A cache that passes through requests for methods it does not
   understand SHOULD invalidate any entities referred to by the
   Request-URI.</source>

          <source>The exact resource identified by an Internet request is determined by
   examining both the Request-URI and the Host header field.

   An origin server that does not allow resources to differ by the
   requested host MAY ignore the Host header field value when
   determining the resource identified by an HTTP/1.1 request. (But see
   &lt;a href=&quot;#section-19.6.1.1&quot;&gt;section 19.6.1.1&lt;/a&gt; for other requirements on Host support in HTTP/1.1.)

   An origin server that does differentiate resources based on the host
   requested (sometimes referred to as virtual hosts or vanity host
   names) MUST use the following rules for determining the requested
   resource on an HTTP/1.1 request:

   1. If Request-URI is an absoluteURI, the host is part of the
     Request-URI. Any Host header field value in the request MUST be
     ignored.

   2. If the Request-URI is not an absoluteURI, and the request includes
     a Host header field, the host is determined by the Host header
     field value.

   3. If the host as determined by rule 1 or 2 is not a valid host on
     the server, the response MUST be a 400 (Bad Request) error message.

   Recipients of an HTTP/1.0 request that lacks a Host header field MAY
   attempt to use heuristics (e.g., examination of the URI path for
   something unique to a particular host) in order to determine what
   exact resource is being requested.</source>

          <source>The expiration time of an entity MAY be specified by the origin
   server using the Expires header (see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.21&quot;&gt;section 14.21&lt;/a&gt;). Alternatively,
   it MAY be specified using the max-age directive in a response. When
   the max-age cache-control directive is present in a cached response,
   the response is stale if its current age is greater than the age
   value given (in seconds) at the time of a new request for that
   resource. The max-age directive on a response implies that the
   response is cacheable (i.e., &quot;public&quot;) unless some other, more
   restrictive cache directive is also present.

   If a response includes both an Expires header and a max-age
   directive, the max-age directive overrides the Expires header, even
   if the Expires header is more restrictive. This rule allows an origin
   server to provide, for a given response, a longer expiration time to
   an HTTP/1.1 (or later) cache than to an HTTP/1.0 cache. This might be
   useful if certain HTTP/1.0 caches improperly calculate ages or
   expiration times, perhaps due to desynchronized clocks.

   Many HTTP/1.0 cache implementations will treat an Expires value that
   is less than or equal to the response Date value as being equivalent
   to the Cache-Control response directive &quot;no-cache&quot;. If an HTTP/1.1
   cache receives such a response, and the response does not include a
   Cache-Control header field, it SHOULD consider the response to be
   non-cacheable in order to retain compatibility with HTTP/1.0 servers.

       Note: An origin server might wish to use a relatively new HTTP
       cache control feature, such as the &quot;private&quot; directive, on a
       network including older caches that do not understand that
       feature. The origin server will need to combine the new feature
       with an Expires field whose value is less than or equal to the
       Date value. This will prevent older caches from improperly
       caching the response. 

   s-maxage
       If a response includes an s-maxage directive, then for a shared
       cache (but not for a private cache), the maximum age specified by
       this directive overrides the maximum age specified by either the
       max-age directive or the Expires header. The s-maxage directive
       also implies the semantics of the proxy-revalidate directive (see
       &lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.9.4&quot;&gt;section 14.9.4&lt;/a&gt;), i.e., that the shared cache must not use the
       entry after it becomes stale to respond to a subsequent request
       without first revalidating it with the origin server. The s-
       maxage directive is always ignored by a private cache.

   Note that most older caches, not compliant with this specification,
   do not implement any cache-control directives. An origin server
   wishing to use a cache-control directive that restricts, but does not
   prevent, caching by an HTTP/1.1-compliant cache MAY exploit the
   requirement that the max-age directive overrides the Expires header,
   and the fact that pre-HTTP/1.1-compliant caches do not observe the
   max-age directive.

   Other directives allow a user agent to modify the basic expiration
   mechanism. These directives MAY be specified on a request:

   max-age
      Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose
      age is no greater than the specified time in seconds. Unless max-
      stale directive is also included, the client is not willing to
      accept a stale response.

   min-fresh
      Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose
      freshness lifetime is no less than its current age plus the
      specified time in seconds. That is, the client wants a response
      that will still be fresh for at least the specified number of
      seconds.

   max-stale
      Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response that has
      exceeded its expiration time. If max-stale is assigned a value,
      then the client is willing to accept a response that has exceeded
      its expiration time by no more than the specified number of
      seconds. If no value is assigned to max-stale, then the client is
      willing to accept a stale response of any age.

   If a cache returns a stale response, either because of a max-stale
   directive on a request, or because the cache is configured to
   override the expiration time of a response, the cache MUST attach a
   Warning header to the stale response, using Warning 110 (Response is
   stale). 

   A cache MAY be configured to return stale responses without
   validation, but only if this does not conflict with any &quot;MUST&quot;-level
   requirements concerning cache validation (e.g., a &quot;must-revalidate&quot;
   cache-control directive).

   If both the new request and the cached entry include &quot;max-age&quot;
   directives, then the lesser of the two values is used for determining
   the freshness of the cached entry for that request.</source>

          <source>The first line of a response message is the status-line, consisting
   of the protocol version, a space (SP), the status code, another
   space, a possibly empty textual phrase describing the status code,
   and ending with CRLF.

     status-line = HTTP-version SP status-code SP reason-phrase CRLF

   The status-code element is a 3-digit integer code describing the
   result of the server's attempt to understand and satisfy the client's
   corresponding request.  The rest of the response message is to be
   interpreted in light of the semantics defined for that status code.
   See &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;6 of [RFC7231]&lt;/a&gt; for information about the semantics of
   status codes, including the classes of status code (indicated by the
   first digit), the status codes defined by this specification,
   considerations for the definition of new status codes, and the IANA
   registry.

     status-code    = 3DIGIT

   The reason-phrase element exists for the sole purpose of providing a
   textual description associated with the numeric status code, mostly
   out of deference to earlier Internet application protocols that were
   more frequently used with interactive text clients.  A client SHOULD
   ignore the reason-phrase content.

   The definition of the propfind element only allows for the allprop or
   the propname element, not both.  Thus, the above is an error and must
   be responded to with a 400 (Bad Request).

   Imagine, however, that a server wanted to be &quot;kind&quot; and decided to
   pick the allprop element as the true element and respond to it.  A
   client running over a bandwidth limited line who intended to execute
   a propname would be in for a big surprise if the server treated the
   command as an allprop.

   Additionally, if a server were lenient and decided to reply to this
   request, the results would vary randomly from server to server, with
   some servers executing the allprop directive, and others executing
   the propname directive.  This reduces interoperability rather than
   increasing it.</source>

          <source>The following rules are used throughout this specification to
   describe basic parsing constructs. The US-ASCII coded character set
   is defined by ANSI X3.4-1986 [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-21&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;]. 

       OCTET          = &amp;lt;any 8-bit sequence of data&amp;gt;
       CHAR           = &amp;lt;any US-ASCII character (octets 0 - 127)&amp;gt;
       UPALPHA        = &amp;lt;any US-ASCII uppercase letter &quot;A&quot;..&quot;Z&quot;&amp;gt;
       LOALPHA        = &amp;lt;any US-ASCII lowercase letter &quot;a&quot;..&quot;z&quot;&amp;gt;
       ALPHA          = UPALPHA | LOALPHA
       DIGIT          = &amp;lt;any US-ASCII digit &quot;0&quot;..&quot;9&quot;&amp;gt;
       CTL            = &amp;lt;any US-ASCII control character
                        (octets 0 - 31) and DEL (127)&amp;gt;
       CR             = &amp;lt;US-ASCII CR, carriage return (13)&amp;gt;
       LF             = &amp;lt;US-ASCII LF, linefeed (10)&amp;gt;
       SP             = &amp;lt;US-ASCII SP, space (32)&amp;gt;
       HT             = &amp;lt;US-ASCII HT, horizontal-tab (9)&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;&quot;&amp;gt;            = &amp;lt;US-ASCII double-quote mark (34)&amp;gt;

   HTTP/1.1 defines the sequence CR LF as the end-of-line marker for all
   protocol elements except the entity-body (see appendix 19.3 for
   tolerant applications). The end-of-line marker within an entity-body
   is defined by its associated media type, as described in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.7&quot;&gt;section 3.7&lt;/a&gt;.

       CRLF           = CR LF

   HTTP/1.1 header field values can be folded onto multiple lines if the
   continuation line begins with a space or horizontal tab. All linear
   white space, including folding, has the same semantics as SP. A
   recipient MAY replace any linear white space with a single SP before
   interpreting the field value or forwarding the message downstream.

       LWS            = [CRLF] 1*( SP | HT )

   The TEXT rule is only used for descriptive field contents and values
   that are not intended to be interpreted by the message parser. Words
   of *TEXT MAY contain characters from character sets other than ISO-
   8859-1 [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-22&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;] only when encoded according to the rules of &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047&quot;&gt;RFC 2047&lt;/a&gt;
   [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-14&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;].

       TEXT           = &amp;lt;any OCTET except CTLs,
                        but including LWS&amp;gt;

   A CRLF is allowed in the definition of TEXT only as part of a header
   field continuation. It is expected that the folding LWS will be
   replaced with a single SP before interpretation of the TEXT value.

   Hexadecimal numeric characters are used in several protocol elements.

       HEX            = &quot;A&quot; | &quot;B&quot; | &quot;C&quot; | &quot;D&quot; | &quot;E&quot; | &quot;F&quot;
                      | &quot;a&quot; | &quot;b&quot; | &quot;c&quot; | &quot;d&quot; | &quot;e&quot; | &quot;f&quot; | DIGIT 

   Many HTTP/1.1 header field values consist of words separated by LWS
   or special characters. These special characters MUST be in a quoted
   string to be used within a parameter value (as defined in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.6&quot;&gt;section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.6&quot;&gt;3.6&lt;/a&gt;).

       token          = 1*&amp;lt;any CHAR except CTLs or separators&amp;gt;
       separators     = &quot;(&quot; | &quot;)&quot; | &quot;&amp;lt;&quot; | &quot;&amp;gt;&quot; | &quot;@&quot;
                      | &quot;,&quot; | &quot;;&quot; | &quot;:&quot; | &quot;\&quot; | &amp;lt;&quot;&amp;gt;
                      | &quot;/&quot; | &quot;[&quot; | &quot;]&quot; | &quot;?&quot; | &quot;=&quot;
                      | &quot;{&quot; | &quot;}&quot; | SP | HT

   Comments can be included in some HTTP header fields by surrounding
   the comment text with parentheses. Comments are only allowed in
   fields containing &quot;comment&quot; as part of their field value definition.
   In all other fields, parentheses are considered part of the field
   value.

       comment        = &quot;(&quot; *( ctext | quoted-pair | comment ) &quot;)&quot;
       ctext          = &amp;lt;any TEXT excluding &quot;(&quot; and &quot;)&quot;&amp;gt;

   A string of text is parsed as a single word if it is quoted using
   double-quote marks.

       quoted-string  = ( &amp;lt;&quot;&amp;gt; *(qdtext | quoted-pair ) &amp;lt;&quot;&amp;gt; )
       qdtext         = &amp;lt;any TEXT except &amp;lt;&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;

   The backslash character (&quot;\&quot;) MAY be used as a single-character
   quoting mechanism only within quoted-string and comment constructs.

       quoted-pair    = &quot;\&quot; CHAR</source>

Finally, if neither header is present, look for a &lt;a href=&quot;headers/last-modified&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Last-Modified&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; header.

          <source>The length of a message body is determined by one of the following
   (in order of precedence):

   1.  Any response to a HEAD request and any response with a 1xx
       (Informational), 204 (No Content), or 304 (Not Modified) status
       code is always terminated by the first empty line after the
       header fields, regardless of the header fields present in the
       message, and thus cannot contain a message body.

   2.  Any 2xx (Successful) response to a CONNECT request implies that
       the connection will become a tunnel immediately after the empty
       line that concludes the header fields.  A client MUST ignore any
       Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header fields received in
       such a message.

   3.  If a Transfer-Encoding header field is present and the chunked
       transfer coding (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-4.1&quot;&gt;Section 4.1&lt;/a&gt;) is the final encoding, the message
       body length is determined by reading and decoding the chunked
       data until the transfer coding indicates the data is complete.

       If a Transfer-Encoding header field is present in a response and
       the chunked transfer coding is not the final encoding, the
       message body length is determined by reading the connection until
       it is closed by the server.  If a Transfer-Encoding header field
       is present in a request and the chunked transfer coding is not
       the final encoding, the message body length cannot be determined
       reliably; the server MUST respond with the 400 (Bad Request)
       status code and then close the connection.

       If a message is received with both a Transfer-Encoding and a
       Content-Length header field, the Transfer-Encoding overrides the
       Content-Length.  Such a message might indicate an attempt to
       perform request smuggling (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-9.5&quot;&gt;Section 9.5&lt;/a&gt;) or response splitting
       (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-9.4&quot;&gt;Section 9.4&lt;/a&gt;) and ought to be handled as an error.  A sender MUST
       remove the received Content-Length field prior to forwarding such
       a message downstream.

   4.  If a message is received without Transfer-Encoding and with
       either multiple Content-Length header fields having differing
       field-values or a single Content-Length header field having an
       invalid value, then the message framing is invalid and the
       recipient MUST treat it as an unrecoverable error.  If this is a
       request message, the server MUST respond with a 400 (Bad Request)
       status code and then close the connection.  If this is a response
       message received by a proxy, the proxy MUST close the connection
       to the server, discard the received response, and send a 502 (Bad 

       Gateway) response to the client.  If this is a response message
       received by a user agent, the user agent MUST close the
       connection to the server and discard the received response.

   5.  If a valid Content-Length header field is present without
       Transfer-Encoding, its decimal value defines the expected message
       body length in octets.  If the sender closes the connection or
       the recipient times out before the indicated number of octets are
       received, the recipient MUST consider the message to be
       incomplete and close the connection.

   6.  If this is a request message and none of the above are true, then
       the message body length is zero (no message body is present).

   7.  Otherwise, this is a response message without a declared message
       body length, so the message body length is determined by the
       number of octets received prior to the server closing the
       connection.

   Since there is no way to distinguish a successfully completed,
   close-delimited message from a partially received message interrupted
   by network failure, a server SHOULD generate encoding or
   length-delimited messages whenever possible.  The close-delimiting
   feature exists primarily for backwards compatibility with HTTP/1.0.

   A server MAY reject a request that contains a message body but not a
   Content-Length by responding with 411 (Length Required).

   Unless a transfer coding other than chunked has been applied, a
   client that sends a request containing a message body SHOULD use a
   valid Content-Length header field if the message body length is known
   in advance, rather than the chunked transfer coding, since some
   existing services respond to chunked with a 411 (Length Required)
   status code even though they understand the chunked transfer coding.
   This is typically because such services are implemented via a gateway
   that requires a content-length in advance of being called and the
   server is unable or unwilling to buffer the entire request before
   processing.

   A user agent that sends a request containing a message body MUST send
   a valid Content-Length header field if it does not know the server
   will handle HTTP/1.1 (or later) requests; such knowledge can be in
   the form of specific user configuration or by remembering the version
   of a prior received response.

   If the final response to the last request on a connection has been
   completely received and there remains additional data to read, a user
   agent MAY discard the remaining data or attempt to determine if that 

   data belongs as part of the prior response body, which might be the
   case if the prior message's Content-Length value is incorrect.  A
   client MUST NOT process, cache, or forward such extra data as a
   separate response, since such behavior would be vulnerable to cache
   poisoning.</source>

   The rules for when a message body is allowed in a message differ for
   requests and responses.

   The presence of a message body in a request is signaled by a
   Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field.  Request message
   framing is independent of method semantics, even if the method does
   not define any use for a message body.

   The presence of a message body in a response depends on both the
   request method to which it is responding and the response status code
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.1.2&quot;&gt;Section 3.1.2&lt;/a&gt;).  Responses to the HEAD request method (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.2&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;4.3.2
   of [RFC7231]&lt;/a&gt;) never include a message body because the associated
   response header fields (e.g., Transfer-Encoding, Content-Length,
   etc.), if present, indicate only what their values would have been if
   the request method had been GET (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.1&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;4.3.1 of [RFC7231]&lt;/a&gt;). 2xx

          <source>The message-body (if any) of an HTTP message is used to carry the
   entity-body associated with the request or response. The message-body
   differs from the entity-body only when a transfer-coding has been
   applied, as indicated by the Transfer-Encoding header field (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.41&quot;&gt;section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.41&quot;&gt;14.41&lt;/a&gt;).

       message-body = entity-body
                    | &amp;lt;entity-body encoded as per Transfer-Encoding&amp;gt;

   Transfer-Encoding MUST be used to indicate any transfer-codings
   applied by an application to ensure safe and proper transfer of the
   message. Transfer-Encoding is a property of the message, not of the 

   entity, and thus MAY be added or removed by any application along the
   request/response chain. (However, &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.6&quot;&gt;section 3.6&lt;/a&gt; places restrictions on
   when certain transfer-codings may be used.)

   The rules for when a message-body is allowed in a message differ for
   requests and responses.

   The presence of a message-body in a request is signaled by the
   inclusion of a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header field in
   the request's message-headers. A message-body MUST NOT be included in
   a request if the specification of the request method (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-5.1.1&quot;&gt;section 5.1.1&lt;/a&gt;)
   does not allow sending an entity-body in requests. A server SHOULD
   read and forward a message-body on any request; if the request method
   does not include defined semantics for an entity-body, then the
   message-body SHOULD be ignored when handling the request.

   For response messages, whether or not a message-body is included with
   a message is dependent on both the request method and the response
   status code (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-6.1.1&quot;&gt;section 6.1.1&lt;/a&gt;). All responses to the HEAD request method
   MUST NOT include a message-body, even though the presence of entity-
   header fields might lead one to believe they do. All 1xx
   (informational), 204 (no content), and 304 (not modified) responses
   MUST NOT include a message-body. All other responses do include a
   message-body, although it MAY be of zero length.</source>

To optimize this, good practices recommend to set expiration times as far in the future as possible. This is possible on resources that are regularly updated, or often, but is problematic for resources that are rarely and infrequently updated. They are the resources that would benefit the most from caching resources, yet this makes them very difficult to update. This is typical of the technical resources included and linked from each Web pages: JavaScript and CSS files change infrequently, but when they change you want them to be updated quickly.</source>

          <source>The most basic form of lock is an exclusive lock.  Exclusive locks
   avoid having to deal with content change conflicts, without requiring
   any coordination other than the methods described in this
   specification.

   However, there are times when the goal of a lock is not to exclude
   others from exercising an access right but rather to provide a
   mechanism for principals to indicate that they intend to exercise
   their access rights.  Shared locks are provided for this case.  A
   shared lock allows multiple principals to receive a lock.  Hence any
   principal that has both access privileges and a valid lock can use
   the locked resource.

   With shared locks, there are two trust sets that affect a resource.
   The first trust set is created by access permissions.  Principals who
   are trusted, for example, may have permission to write to the
   resource.  Among those who have access permission to write to the
   resource, the set of principals who have taken out a shared lock also
   must trust each other, creating a (typically) smaller trust set
   within the access permission write set.

   Starting with every possible principal on the Internet, in most
   situations the vast majority of these principals will not have write
   access to a given resource.  Of the small number who do have write
   access, some principals may decide to guarantee their edits are free
   from overwrite conflicts by using exclusive write locks.  Others may
   decide they trust their collaborators will not overwrite their work
   (the potential set of collaborators being the set of principals who
   have write permission) and use a shared lock, which informs their
   collaborators that a principal may be working on the resource.

   The WebDAV extensions to HTTP do not need to provide all of the
   communications paths necessary for principals to coordinate their
   activities.  When using shared locks, principals may use any out-of-
   band communication channel to coordinate their work (e.g., face-to-
   face interaction, written notes, post-it notes on the screen,
   telephone conversation, email, etc.)  The intent of a shared lock is
   to let collaborators know who else may be working on a resource.

   Shared locks are included because experience from Web-distributed
   authoring systems has indicated that exclusive locks are often too
   rigid.  An exclusive lock is used to enforce a particular editing
   process: take out an exclusive lock, read the resource, perform
   edits, write the resource, release the lock.  This editing process
   has the problem that locks are not always properly released, for
   example, when a program crashes or when a lock creator leaves without 

   unlocking a resource.  While both timeouts (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-6.6&quot;&gt;Section 6.6&lt;/a&gt;) and
   administrative action can be used to remove an offending lock,
   neither mechanism may be available when needed; the timeout may be
   long or the administrator may not be available.

   A successful request for a new shared lock MUST result in the
   generation of a unique lock associated with the requesting principal.
   Thus, if five principals have taken out shared write locks on the
   same resource, there will be five locks and five lock tokens, one for
   each principal.</source>

          <source>The most common form of request-target is the origin-form.

     origin-form    = absolute-path [ &quot;?&quot; query ]

   When making a request directly to an origin server, other than a
   CONNECT or server-wide OPTIONS request (as detailed below), a client
   MUST send only the absolute path and query components of the target
   URI as the request-target.  If the target URI's path component is
   empty, the client MUST send &quot;/&quot; as the path within the origin-form of
   request-target.  A Host header field is also sent, as defined in
   &lt;a href=&quot;#section-5.4&quot;&gt;Section 5.4&lt;/a&gt;.

   For example, a client wishing to retrieve a representation of the
   resource identified as

     http://www.example.org/where?q=now

   directly from the origin server would open (or reuse) a TCP
   connection to port 80 of the host &quot;www.example.org&quot; and send the
   lines:

     GET /where?q=now HTTP/1.1
     Host: www.example.org

          <source>The order in which header fields with differing field names are
   received is not significant.  However, it is good practice to send
   header fields that contain control data first, such as Host on
   requests and Date on responses, so that implementations can decide
   when not to handle a message as early as possible.  A server MUST NOT
   apply a request to the target resource until the entire request 

   header section is received, since later header fields might include
   conditionals, authentication credentials, or deliberately misleading
   duplicate header fields that would impact request processing.

   A sender MUST NOT generate multiple header fields with the same field
   name in a message unless either the entire field value for that
   header field is defined as a comma-separated list [i.e., #(values)]
   or the header field is a well-known exception (as noted below).

   A recipient MAY combine multiple header fields with the same field
   name into one &quot;field-name: field-value&quot; pair, without changing the
   semantics of the message, by appending each subsequent field value to
   the combined field value in order, separated by a comma.  The order
   in which header fields with the same field name are received is
   therefore significant to the interpretation of the combined field
   value; a proxy MUST NOT change the order of these field values when
   forwarding a message.

      Note: In practice, the &quot;Set-Cookie&quot; header field ([&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265&quot;&gt;RFC6265&lt;/a&gt;]) often
      appears multiple times in a response message and does not use the
      list syntax, violating the above requirements on multiple header
      fields with the same name.  Since it cannot be combined into a
      single field-value, recipients ought to handle &quot;Set-Cookie&quot; as a
      special case while processing header fields.  (See &lt;a href=&quot;#appendix-A.2.3&quot;&gt;Appendix A.2.3&lt;/a&gt;

          <source>The original WebDAV model for locking unmapped URLs created &quot;lock-
   null resources&quot;.  This model was over-complicated and some
   interoperability and implementation problems were discovered.  The
   new WebDAV model for locking unmapped URLs (see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-7.3&quot;&gt;Section 7.3&lt;/a&gt;) creates
   &quot;locked empty resources&quot;.  Lock-null resources are deprecated.  This
   section discusses the original model briefly because clients MUST be
   able to handle either model.

   In the original &quot;lock-null resource&quot; model, which is no longer
   recommended for implementation:

   o  A lock-null resource sometimes appeared as &quot;Not Found&quot;.  The
      server responds with a 404 or 405 to any method except for PUT,
      MKCOL, OPTIONS, PROPFIND, LOCK, UNLOCK.

   o  A lock-null resource does however show up as a member of its
      parent collection.

   o  The server removes the lock-null resource entirely (its URI
      becomes unmapped) if its lock goes away before it is converted to
      a regular resource.  Recall that locks go away not only when they
      expire or are unlocked, but are also removed if a resource is
      renamed or moved, or if any parent collection is renamed or moved. 

   o  The server converts the lock-null resource into a regular resource
      if a PUT request to the URL is successful.

   o  The server converts the lock-null resource into a collection if a
      MKCOL request to the URL is successful (though interoperability
      experience showed that not all servers followed this requirement).

   o  Property values were defined for DAV:lockdiscovery and DAV:
      supportedlock properties but not necessarily for other properties
      like DAV:getcontenttype.

   Clients can easily interoperate both with servers that support the
   old model &quot;lock-null resources&quot; and the recommended model of &quot;locked
   empty resources&quot; by only attempting PUT after a LOCK to an unmapped
   URL, not MKCOL or GET.</source>

It has been further extended for specific applications like CardDAV to handle address book entries and CalDAV to deal with calendars.

          <source>The previous example was illegal because it contained two elements
   that were explicitly banned from appearing together in the propfind
   element.  However, XML is an extensible language, so one can imagine
   new elements being defined for use with propfind.  Below is the
   request body of a PROPFIND and, like the previous example, must be
   rejected with a 400 (Bad Request) by a server that does not
   understand the expired-props element.

      &amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;D:propfind xmlns:D=&quot;DAV:&quot;
      xmlns:E=&quot;http://www.example.com/standards/props/&quot;&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;E:expired-props/&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/D:propfind&amp;gt;

   To understand why a 400 (Bad Request) is returned, let us look at the
   request body as the server unfamiliar with expired-props sees it.

      &amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;D:propfind xmlns:D=&quot;DAV:&quot;
                  xmlns:E=&quot;http://www.example.com/standards/props/&quot;&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/D:propfind&amp;gt;

   As the server does not understand the 'expired-props' element,
   according to the WebDAV-specific XML processing rules specified in
   &lt;a href=&quot;#section-17&quot;&gt;Section 17&lt;/a&gt;, it must process the request as if the element were not
   there.  Thus, the server sees an empty propfind, which by the
   definition of the propfind element is illegal.

   Please note that had the extension been additive, it would not
   necessarily have resulted in a 400 (Bad Request).  For example,
   imagine the following request body for a PROPFIND:


      &amp;lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;D:propfind xmlns:D=&quot;DAV:&quot;
                  xmlns:E=&quot;http://www.example.com/standards/props/&quot;&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;D:propname/&amp;gt;
       &amp;lt;E:leave-out&amp;gt;*boss*&amp;lt;/E:leave-out&amp;gt;
      &amp;lt;/D:propfind&amp;gt;

   The previous example contains the fictitious element leave-out.  Its
   purpose is to prevent the return of any property whose name matches
   the submitted pattern.  If the previous example were submitted to a
   server unfamiliar with 'leave-out', the only result would be that the
   'leave-out' element would be ignored and a propname would be
   executed.</source>

          <source>The primary changes in this revision have been editorial in nature:
   extracting the messaging syntax and partitioning HTTP semantics into
   separate documents for the core features, conditional requests,
   partial requests, caching, and authentication.  The conformance
   language has been revised to clearly target requirements and the
   terminology has been improved to distinguish payload from
   representations and representations from resources.

   A new requirement has been added that semantics embedded in a URI be
   disabled when those semantics are inconsistent with the request
   method, since this is a common cause of interoperability failure.
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-2&quot;&gt;Section 2&lt;/a&gt;)

   An algorithm has been added for determining if a payload is
   associated with a specific identifier.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.1.4.1&quot;&gt;Section 3.1.4.1&lt;/a&gt;)

   The default charset of ISO-8859-1 for text media types has been
   removed; the default is now whatever the media type definition says.
   Likewise, special treatment of ISO-8859-1 has been removed from the
   Accept-Charset header field.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.1.1.3&quot;&gt;Section 3.1.1.3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#section-5.3.3&quot;&gt;Section 5.3.3&lt;/a&gt;)

   The definition of Content-Location has been changed to no longer
   affect the base URI for resolving relative URI references, due to
   poor implementation support and the undesirable effect of potentially
   breaking relative links in content-negotiated resources.
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.1.4.2&quot;&gt;Section 3.1.4.2&lt;/a&gt;)

   To be consistent with the method-neutral parsing algorithm of
   [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230&quot;&gt;RFC7230&lt;/a&gt;], the definition of GET has been relaxed so that requests
   can have a body, even though a body has no meaning for GET.
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-4.3.1&quot;&gt;Section 4.3.1&lt;/a&gt;)

   Servers are no longer required to handle all Content-* header fields
   and use of Content-Range has been explicitly banned in PUT requests.
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-4.3.4&quot;&gt;Section 4.3.4&lt;/a&gt;)

   Definition of the CONNECT method has been moved from [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2817&quot;&gt;RFC2817&lt;/a&gt;] to
   this specification.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-4.3.6&quot;&gt;Section 4.3.6&lt;/a&gt;)

   The OPTIONS and TRACE request methods have been defined as being
   safe.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-4.3.7&quot;&gt;Section 4.3.7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#section-4.3.8&quot;&gt;Section 4.3.8&lt;/a&gt;) 

   The Expect header field's extension mechanism has been removed due to
   widely-deployed broken implementations.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-5.1.1&quot;&gt;Section 5.1.1&lt;/a&gt;)

   The Max-Forwards header field has been restricted to the OPTIONS and
   TRACE methods; previously, extension methods could have used it as
   well.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-5.1.2&quot;&gt;Section 5.1.2&lt;/a&gt;)

   The &quot;about:blank&quot; URI has been suggested as a value for the Referer
   header field when no referring URI is applicable, which distinguishes
   that case from others where the Referer field is not sent or has been
   removed.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-5.5.2&quot;&gt;Section 5.5.2&lt;/a&gt;)

   The following status codes are now cacheable (that is, they can be
   stored and reused by a cache without explicit freshness information
   present): 204, 404, 405, 414, 501.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-6&quot;&gt;Section 6&lt;/a&gt;)

   The 201 (Created) status description has been changed to allow for
   the possibility that more than one resource has been created.
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-6.3.2&quot;&gt;Section 6.3.2&lt;/a&gt;)

   The definition of 203 (Non-Authoritative Information) has been
   broadened to include cases of payload transformations as well.
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-6.3.4&quot;&gt;Section 6.3.4&lt;/a&gt;)

   The set of request methods that are safe to automatically redirect is
   no longer closed; user agents are able to make that determination
   based upon the request method semantics.  The redirect status codes
   301, 302, and 307 no longer have normative requirements on response
   payloads and user interaction.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-6.4&quot;&gt;Section 6.4&lt;/a&gt;)

   The status codes 301 and 302 have been changed to allow user agents
   to rewrite the method from POST to GET.  (Sections &lt;a href=&quot;#section-6.4.2&quot;&gt;6.4.2&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#section-6.4.3&quot;&gt;6.4.3&lt;/a&gt;)

   The description of the 303 (See Other) status code has been changed
   to allow it to be cached if explicit freshness information is given,
   and a specific definition has been added for a 303 response to GET.
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-6.4.4&quot;&gt;Section 6.4.4&lt;/a&gt;)

   The 305 (Use Proxy) status code has been deprecated due to security
   concerns regarding in-band configuration of a proxy.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-6.4.5&quot;&gt;Section 6.4.5&lt;/a&gt;)

   The 400 (Bad Request) status code has been relaxed so that it isn't
   limited to syntax errors.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-6.5.1&quot;&gt;Section 6.5.1&lt;/a&gt;)

   The 426 (Upgrade Required) status code has been incorporated from
   [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2817&quot;&gt;RFC2817&lt;/a&gt;].  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-6.5.15&quot;&gt;Section 6.5.15&lt;/a&gt;) 

   The target of requirements on HTTP-date and the Date header field
   have been reduced to those systems generating the date, rather than
   all systems sending a date.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-7.1.1&quot;&gt;Section 7.1.1&lt;/a&gt;)

   The syntax of the Location header field has been changed to allow all
   URI references, including relative references and fragments, along
   with some clarifications as to when use of fragments would not be
   appropriate.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-7.1.2&quot;&gt;Section 7.1.2&lt;/a&gt;)

   Allow has been reclassified as a response header field, removing the
   option to specify it in a PUT request.  Requirements relating to the
   content of Allow have been relaxed; correspondingly, clients are not
   required to always trust its value.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-7.4.1&quot;&gt;Section 7.4.1&lt;/a&gt;)

   A Method Registry has been defined.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-8.1&quot;&gt;Section 8.1&lt;/a&gt;)

   The Status Code Registry has been redefined by this specification;
   previously, it was defined in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2817#section-7.1&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;7.1 of [RFC2817]&lt;/a&gt;.

   Registration of content codings has been changed to require IETF
   Review.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-8.4&quot;&gt;Section 8.4&lt;/a&gt;)

   The Content-Disposition header field has been removed since it is now
   defined by [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6266&quot;&gt;RFC6266&lt;/a&gt;].

   The Content-MD5 header field has been removed because it was

          <source>The principle behind entity-tags is that only the service author
   knows the implementation of a resource well enough to select the most
   accurate and efficient validation mechanism for that resource, and
   that any such mechanism can be mapped to a simple sequence of octets
   for easy comparison.  Since the value is opaque, there is no need for
   the client to be aware of how each entity-tag is constructed.

   For example, a resource that has implementation-specific versioning
   applied to all changes might use an internal revision number, perhaps
   combined with a variance identifier for content negotiation, to
   accurately differentiate between representations.  Other
   implementations might use a collision-resistant hash of
   representation content, a combination of various file attributes, or
   a modification timestamp that has sub-second resolution.

   An origin server SHOULD send an ETag for any selected representation
   for which detection of changes can be reasonably and consistently
   determined, since the entity-tag's use in conditional requests and
   evaluating cache freshness ([&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234&quot;&gt;RFC7234&lt;/a&gt;]) can result in a substantial
   reduction of HTTP network traffic and can be a significant factor in
   improving service scalability and reliability.</source>

          <source>The purpose of the 100 (Continue) status (see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-10.1.1&quot;&gt;section 10.1.1&lt;/a&gt;) is to
   allow a client that is sending a request message with a request body
   to determine if the origin server is willing to accept the request
   (based on the request headers) before the client sends the request
   body. In some cases, it might either be inappropriate or highly
   inefficient for the client to send the body if the server will reject
   the message without looking at the body.

   Requirements for HTTP/1.1 clients:

      - If a client will wait for a 100 (Continue) response before
        sending the request body, it MUST send an Expect request-header
        field (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.20&quot;&gt;section 14.20&lt;/a&gt;) with the &quot;100-continue&quot; expectation.

      - A client MUST NOT send an Expect request-header field (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.20&quot;&gt;section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.20&quot;&gt;14.20&lt;/a&gt;) with the &quot;100-continue&quot; expectation if it does not intend
        to send a request body.

   Because of the presence of older implementations, the protocol allows
   ambiguous situations in which a client may send &quot;Expect: 100-
   continue&quot; without receiving either a 417 (Expectation Failed) status
   or a 100 (Continue) status. Therefore, when a client sends this
   header field to an origin server (possibly via a proxy) from which it
   has never seen a 100 (Continue) status, the client SHOULD NOT wait
   for an indefinite period before sending the request body.

   Requirements for HTTP/1.1 origin servers:

      - Upon receiving a request which includes an Expect request-header
        field with the &quot;100-continue&quot; expectation, an origin server MUST
        either respond with 100 (Continue) status and continue to read
        from the input stream, or respond with a final status code. The
        origin server MUST NOT wait for the request body before sending
        the 100 (Continue) response. If it responds with a final status
        code, it MAY close the transport connection or it MAY continue 

        to read and discard the rest of the request.  It MUST NOT
        perform the requested method if it returns a final status code.

      - An origin server SHOULD NOT send a 100 (Continue) response if
        the request message does not include an Expect request-header
        field with the &quot;100-continue&quot; expectation, and MUST NOT send a
        100 (Continue) response if such a request comes from an HTTP/1.0
        (or earlier) client. There is an exception to this rule: for
        compatibility with &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068&quot;&gt;RFC 2068&lt;/a&gt;, a server MAY send a 100 (Continue)
        status in response to an HTTP/1.1 PUT or POST request that does
        not include an Expect request-header field with the &quot;100-
        continue&quot; expectation. This exception, the purpose of which is
        to minimize any client processing delays associated with an
        undeclared wait for 100 (Continue) status, applies only to
        HTTP/1.1 requests, and not to requests with any other HTTP-
        version value.

      - An origin server MAY omit a 100 (Continue) response if it has
        already received some or all of the request body for the
        corresponding request.

      - An origin server that sends a 100 (Continue) response MUST
        ultimately send a final status code, once the request body is
        received and processed, unless it terminates the transport
        connection prematurely.

      - If an origin server receives a request that does not include an
        Expect request-header field with the &quot;100-continue&quot; expectation,
        the request includes a request body, and the server responds
        with a final status code before reading the entire request body
        from the transport connection, then the server SHOULD NOT close
        the transport connection until it has read the entire request,
        or until the client closes the connection. Otherwise, the client
        might not reliably receive the response message. However, this
        requirement is not be construed as preventing a server from
        defending itself against denial-of-service attacks, or from
        badly broken client implementations.

   Requirements for HTTP/1.1 proxies:

      - If a proxy receives a request that includes an Expect request-
        header field with the &quot;100-continue&quot; expectation, and the proxy
        either knows that the next-hop server complies with HTTP/1.1 or
        higher, or does not know the HTTP version of the next-hop
        server, it MUST forward the request, including the Expect header
        field. 

      - If the proxy knows that the version of the next-hop server is
        HTTP/1.0 or lower, it MUST NOT forward the request, and it MUST
        respond with a 417 (Expectation Failed) status.

      - Proxies SHOULD maintain a cache recording the HTTP version
        numbers received from recently-referenced next-hop servers.

      - A proxy MUST NOT forward a 100 (Continue) response if the
        request message was received from an HTTP/1.0 (or earlier)
        client and did not include an Expect request-header field with
        the &quot;100-continue&quot; expectation. This requirement overrides the
        general rule for forwarding of 1xx responses (see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-10.1&quot;&gt;section 10.1&lt;/a&gt;).</source>

          <source>The request method token is the primary source of request semantics;
   it indicates the purpose for which the client has made this request
   and what is expected by the client as a successful result.

   The request method's semantics might be further specialized by the
   semantics of some header fields when present in a request (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-5&quot;&gt;Section 5&lt;/a&gt;)
   if those additional semantics do not conflict with the method.  For
   example, a client can send conditional request header fields
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-5.2&quot;&gt;Section 5.2&lt;/a&gt;) to make the requested action conditional on the current
   state of the target resource ([&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232&quot;&gt;RFC7232&lt;/a&gt;]).

     method = token

   HTTP was originally designed to be usable as an interface to
   distributed object systems.  The request method was envisioned as
   applying semantics to a target resource in much the same way as
   invoking a defined method on an identified object would apply
   semantics.  The method token is case-sensitive because it might be
   used as a gateway to object-based systems with case-sensitive method
   names.

   Unlike distributed objects, the standardized request methods in HTTP
   are not resource-specific, since uniform interfaces provide for
   better visibility and reuse in network-based systems [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-REST&quot;&gt;REST&lt;/a&gt;].  Once
   defined, a standardized method ought to have the same semantics when
   applied to any resource, though each resource determines for itself
   whether those semantics are implemented or allowed.

   This specification defines a number of standardized methods that are
   commonly used in HTTP, as outlined by the following table.  By
   convention, standardized methods are defined in all-uppercase
   US-ASCII letters. 

   +---------+-------------------------------------------------+-------+
   | Method  | Description                                     | Sec.  |
   +---------+-------------------------------------------------+-------+
   | GET     | Transfer a current representation of the target | 4.3.1 |
   |         | resource.                                       |       |
   | HEAD    | Same as GET, but only transfer the status line  | 4.3.2 |
   |         | and header section.                             |       |
   | POST    | Perform resource-specific processing on the     | 4.3.3 |
   |         | request payload.                                |       |
   | PUT     | Replace all current representations of the      | 4.3.4 |
   |         | target resource with the request payload.       |       |
   | DELETE  | Remove all current representations of the       | 4.3.5 |
   |         | target resource.                                |       |
   | CONNECT | Establish a tunnel to the server identified by  | 4.3.6 |
   |         | the target resource.                            |       |
   | OPTIONS | Describe the communication options for the      | 4.3.7 |
   |         | target resource.                                |       |
   | TRACE   | Perform a message loop-back test along the path | 4.3.8 |
   |         | to the target resource.                         |       |
   +---------+-------------------------------------------------+-------+

   All general-purpose servers MUST support the methods GET and HEAD.
   All other methods are OPTIONAL.

   Additional methods, outside the scope of this specification, have
   been standardized for use in HTTP.  All such methods ought to be
   registered within the &quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) Method
   Registry&quot; maintained by IANA, as defined in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-8.1&quot;&gt;Section 8.1&lt;/a&gt;.

   The set of methods allowed by a target resource can be listed in an
   Allow header field (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-7.4.1&quot;&gt;Section 7.4.1&lt;/a&gt;).  However, the set of allowed
   methods can change dynamically.  When a request method is received
   that is unrecognized or not implemented by an origin server, the
   origin server SHOULD respond with the 501 (Not Implemented) status
   code.  When a request method is received that is known by an origin
   server but not allowed for the target resource, the origin server
   SHOULD respond with the 405 (Method Not Allowed) status code.</source>

          <source>The request requires user authentication. The response MUST include a

   request with a suitable Authorization header field (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.8&quot;&gt;section 14.8&lt;/a&gt;). If

   Request-header field names can be extended reliably only in
   combination with a change in the protocol version. However, new or
   experimental header fields MAY be given the semantics of request-
   header fields if all parties in the communication recognize them to

   If the 307 status code is received in response to a request other

      of the original request method. The status codes 303 and 307 have
      been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which

   Older HTTP/1.0 clients assumed a one-to-one relationship of IP
   addresses and servers; there was no other established mechanism for
   distinguishing the intended server of a request than the IP address
   to which that request was directed. The changes outlined above will
   allow the Internet, once older HTTP clients are no longer common, to
   support multiple Web sites from a single IP address, greatly
   simplifying large operational Web servers, where allocation of many
   IP addresses to a single host has created serious problems. The
   Internet will also be able to recover the IP addresses that have been
   allocated for the sole purpose of allowing special-purpose domain
   names to be used in root-level HTTP URLs. Given the rate of growth of
   the Web, and the number of servers already deployed, it is extremely 

   important that all implementations of HTTP (including updates to
   existing HTTP/1.0 applications) correctly implement these
   requirements:

      - Both clients and servers MUST support the Host request-header.

      - A client that sends an HTTP/1.1 request MUST send a Host header.

      - Servers MUST report a 400 (Bad Request) error if an HTTP/1.1
        request does not include a Host request-header.

      - Servers MUST accept absolute URIs.</source>

   Unless it was a HEAD request, the response SHOULD include an entity

      an incoming response to determine if it is acceptable.

   The request MUST have included a Range header field (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.35&quot;&gt;section 14.35&lt;/a&gt;)
   indicating the desired range, and MAY have included an If-Range
   header field (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.27&quot;&gt;section 14.27&lt;/a&gt;) to make the request conditional.

   The response MUST include the following header fields:

      - Either a Content-Range header field (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.16&quot;&gt;section 14.16&lt;/a&gt;) indicating
        the range included with this response, or a multipart/byteranges
        Content-Type including Content-Range fields for each part. If a
        Content-Length header field is present in the response, its
        value MUST match the actual number of OCTETs transmitted in the
        message-body.

      - Date

      - ETag and/or Content-Location, if the header would have been sent
        in a 200 response to the same request 

      - Expires, Cache-Control, and/or Vary, if the field-value might
        differ from that sent in any previous response for the same
        variant

   If the 206 response is the result of an If-Range request that used a
   strong cache validator (see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-13.3.3&quot;&gt;section 13.3.3&lt;/a&gt;), the response SHOULD NOT
   include other entity-headers. If the response is the result of an
   If-Range request that used a weak validator, the response MUST NOT
   include other entity-headers; this prevents inconsistencies between
   cached entity-bodies and updated headers. Otherwise, the response
   MUST include all of the entity-headers that would have been returned
   with a 200 (OK) response to the same request.

   A cache MUST NOT combine a 206 response with other previously cached
   content if the ETag or Last-Modified headers do not match exactly,
   see 13.5.4.

   A cache that does not support the Range and Content-Range headers
   MUST NOT cache 206 (Partial) responses.</source>

          <source>The specification has been substantially rewritten for clarity.

   The conditions under which an authenticated response can be cached
   have been clarified.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.2&quot;&gt;Section 3.2&lt;/a&gt;)

   New status codes can now define that caches are allowed to use
   heuristic freshness with them.  Caches are now allowed to calculate
   heuristic freshness for URIs with query components.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-4.2.2&quot;&gt;Section 4.2.2&lt;/a&gt;)

   The algorithm for calculating age is now less conservative.  Caches
   are now required to handle dates with time zones as if they're
   invalid, because it's not possible to accurately guess.
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-4.2.3&quot;&gt;Section 4.2.3&lt;/a&gt;)

   The Content-Location response header field is no longer used to
   determine the appropriate response to use when validating.
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-4.3&quot;&gt;Section 4.3&lt;/a&gt;)

   The algorithm for selecting a cached negotiated response to use has
   been clarified in several ways.  In particular, it now explicitly
   allows header-specific canonicalization when processing selecting
   header fields.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-4.1&quot;&gt;Section 4.1&lt;/a&gt;)

   Requirements regarding denial-of-service attack avoidance when
   performing invalidation have been clarified.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-4.4&quot;&gt;Section 4.4&lt;/a&gt;)

   Cache invalidation only occurs when a successful response is
   received.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-4.4&quot;&gt;Section 4.4&lt;/a&gt;)

   Cache directives are explicitly defined to be case-insensitive.
   Handling of multiple instances of cache directives when only one is
   expected is now defined.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-5.2&quot;&gt;Section 5.2&lt;/a&gt;)

   The &quot;no-store&quot; request directive doesn't apply to responses; i.e., a
   cache can satisfy a request with no-store on it and does not
   invalidate it.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-5.2.1.5&quot;&gt;Section 5.2.1.5&lt;/a&gt;)

   The qualified forms of the private and no-cache cache directives are
   noted to not be widely implemented; for example, &quot;private=foo&quot; is
   interpreted by many caches as simply &quot;private&quot;.  Additionally, the
   meaning of the qualified form of no-cache has been clarified.
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-5.2.2&quot;&gt;Section 5.2.2&lt;/a&gt;)

   The &quot;no-cache&quot; response directive's meaning has been clarified.
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-5.2.2.2&quot;&gt;Section 5.2.2.2&lt;/a&gt;) 

   The one-year limit on Expires header field values has been removed;
   instead, the reasoning for using a sensible value is given.
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-5.3&quot;&gt;Section 5.3&lt;/a&gt;)

   The Pragma header field is now only defined for backwards
   compatibility; future pragmas are deprecated.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-5.4&quot;&gt;Section 5.4&lt;/a&gt;)

   Some requirements regarding production and processing of the Warning
   header fields have been relaxed, as it is not widely implemented.
   Furthermore, the Warning header field no longer uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047&quot;&gt;RFC 2047&lt;/a&gt;
   encoding, nor does it allow multiple languages, as these aspects were
   not implemented.  (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-5.5&quot;&gt;Section 5.5&lt;/a&gt;)

   This specification introduces the Cache Directive and Warn Code
   Registries, and defines considerations for new cache directives.
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-7.1&quot;&gt;Section 7.1&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;#section-7.2&quot;&gt;Section 7.2&lt;/a&gt;)</source>

          <source>The status-code element is a three-digit integer code giving the
   result of the attempt to understand and satisfy the request.

   HTTP status codes are extensible.  HTTP clients are not required to
   understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such
   understanding is obviously desirable.  However, a client MUST
   understand the class of any status code, as indicated by the first
   digit, and treat an unrecognized status code as being equivalent to
   the x00 status code of that class, with the exception that a
   recipient MUST NOT cache a response with an unrecognized status code.

   For example, if an unrecognized status code of 471 is received by a
   client, the client can assume that there was something wrong with its
   request and treat the response as if it had received a 400 (Bad
   Request) status code.  The response message will usually contain a
   representation that explains the status.

   The first digit of the status-code defines the class of response.
   The last two digits do not have any categorization role.  There are
   five values for the first digit:

   o  1xx (Informational): The request was received, continuing process

   o  2xx (Successful): The request was successfully received,
      understood, and accepted

   o  3xx (Redirection): Further action needs to be taken in order to
      complete the request

   o  4xx (Client Error): The request contains bad syntax or cannot be
      fulfilled 

   o  5xx (Server Error): The server failed to fulfill an apparently
      valid request</source>

          <source>The table below describes the behavior that occurs when a lock
   request is made on a resource.

     +--------------------------+----------------+-------------------+

     +--------------------------+----------------+-------------------+
     | None                     | True           | True              |

   Legend: True = lock may be granted.  False = lock MUST NOT be

   twice.

   The current lock state of a resource is given in the leftmost column,
   and lock requests are listed in the first row.  The intersection of a
   row and column gives the result of a lock request.  For example, if a
   shared lock is held on a resource, and an exclusive lock is
   requested, the table entry is &quot;false&quot;, indicating that the lock must
   not be granted.</source>

          <source>The target of an HTTP request is called a &quot;resource&quot;.  HTTP does not
   limit the nature of a resource; it merely defines an interface that
   might be used to interact with resources.  Each resource is
   identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), as described in
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.7&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;2.7 of [RFC7230]&lt;/a&gt;.

   When a client constructs an HTTP/1.1 request message, it sends the
   target URI in one of various forms, as defined in (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.3&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;5.3 of
   [RFC7230]&lt;/a&gt;).  When a request is received, the server reconstructs an
   effective request URI for the target resource (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-5.5&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;5.5 of
   [RFC7230]&lt;/a&gt;).

   One design goal of HTTP is to separate resource identification from
   request semantics, which is made possible by vesting the request
   semantics in the request method (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-4&quot;&gt;Section 4&lt;/a&gt;) and a few
   request-modifying header fields (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-5&quot;&gt;Section 5&lt;/a&gt;).  If there is a conflict
   between the method semantics and any semantic implied by the URI
   itself, as described in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-4.2.1&quot;&gt;Section 4.2.1&lt;/a&gt;, the method semantics take
   precedence.</source>

          <source>The transfer-length of a message is the length of the message-body as
   it appears in the message; that is, after any transfer-codings have
   been applied. When a message-body is included with a message, the
   transfer-length of that body is determined by one of the following
   (in order of precedence):

   1.Any response message which &quot;MUST NOT&quot; include a message-body (such
     as the 1xx, 204, and 304 responses and any response to a HEAD
     request) is always terminated by the first empty line after the
     header fields, regardless of the entity-header fields present in
     the message.

   2.If a Transfer-Encoding header field (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.41&quot;&gt;section 14.41&lt;/a&gt;) is present and
     has any value other than &quot;identity&quot;, then the transfer-length is
     defined by use of the &quot;chunked&quot; transfer-coding (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.6&quot;&gt;section 3.6&lt;/a&gt;),
     unless the message is terminated by closing the connection.

   3.If a Content-Length header field (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.13&quot;&gt;section 14.13&lt;/a&gt;) is present, its
     decimal value in OCTETs represents both the entity-length and the
     transfer-length. The Content-Length header field MUST NOT be sent
     if these two lengths are different (i.e., if a Transfer-Encoding 

     header field is present). If a message is received with both a
     Transfer-Encoding header field and a Content-Length header field,
     the latter MUST be ignored.

   4.If the message uses the media type &quot;multipart/byteranges&quot;, and the
     ransfer-length is not otherwise specified, then this self-
     elimiting media type defines the transfer-length. This media type
     UST NOT be used unless the sender knows that the recipient can arse
     it; the presence in a request of a Range header with ultiple byte-
     range specifiers from a 1.1 client implies that the lient can parse
     multipart/byteranges responses.

       A range header might be forwarded by a 1.0 proxy that does not
       understand multipart/byteranges; in this case the server MUST
       delimit the message using methods defined in items 1,3 or 5 of
       this section.

   5.By the server closing the connection. (Closing the connection
     cannot be used to indicate the end of a request body, since that
     would leave no possibility for the server to send back a response.)

   For compatibility with HTTP/1.0 applications, HTTP/1.1 requests
   containing a message-body MUST include a valid Content-Length header
   field unless the server is known to be HTTP/1.1 compliant. If a
   request contains a message-body and a Content-Length is not given,
   the server SHOULD respond with 400 (bad request) if it cannot
   determine the length of the message, or with 411 (length required) if
   it wishes to insist on receiving a valid Content-Length.

   All HTTP/1.1 applications that receive entities MUST accept the
   &quot;chunked&quot; transfer-coding (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.6&quot;&gt;section 3.6&lt;/a&gt;), thus allowing this mechanism
   to be used for messages when the message length cannot be determined
   in advance.

   Messages MUST NOT include both a Content-Length header field and a
   non-identity transfer-coding. If the message does include a non-
   identity transfer-coding, the Content-Length MUST be ignored.

   When a Content-Length is given in a message where a message-body is
   allowed, its field value MUST exactly match the number of OCTETs in
   the message-body. HTTP/1.1 user agents MUST notify the user when an
   invalid length is received and detected.</source>

          <source>The value of a property is always a (well-formed) XML fragment.

   XML has been chosen because it is a flexible, self-describing,
   structured data format that supports rich schema definitions, and
   because of its support for multiple character sets.  XML's self-
   describing nature allows any property's value to be extended by
   adding elements.  Clients will not break when they encounter
   extensions because they will still have the data specified in the
   original schema and MUST ignore elements they do not understand. 

   XML's support for multiple character sets allows any human-readable
   property to be encoded and read in a character set familiar to the
   user.  XML's support for multiple human languages, using the &quot;xml:
   lang&quot; attribute, handles cases where the same character set is
   employed by multiple human languages.  Note that xml:lang scope is
   recursive, so an xml:lang attribute on any element containing a
   property name element applies to the property value unless it has
   been overridden by a more locally scoped attribute.  Note that a
   property only has one value, in one language (or language MAY be left
   undefined); a property does not have multiple values in different
   languages or a single value in multiple languages.

   A property is always represented with an XML element consisting of
   the property name, called the &quot;property name element&quot;.  The simplest
   example is an empty property, which is different from a property that
   does not exist:

      &amp;lt;R:title xmlns:R=&quot;http://www.example.com/ns/&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/R:title&amp;gt;

   The value of the property appears inside the property name element.
   The value may be any kind of well-formed XML content, including both
   text-only and mixed content.  Servers MUST preserve the following XML
   Information Items (using the terminology from [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-REC-XML-INFOSET&quot;&gt;REC-XML-INFOSET&lt;/a&gt;]) in
   storage and transmission of dead properties:

   For the property name Element Information Item itself:

      [namespace name]

      [local name]

      [&lt;a id=&quot;ref-attributes&quot; name=&quot;ref-attributes&quot;&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt;] named &quot;xml:lang&quot; or any such attribute in scope

      [&lt;a id=&quot;ref-children&quot; name=&quot;ref-children&quot;&gt;children&lt;/a&gt;] of type element or character

   On all Element Information Items in the property value:

      [namespace name]

      [local name]

      [&lt;a id=&quot;ref-attributes&quot; name=&quot;ref-attributes&quot;&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt;]

      [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-children&quot;&gt;children&lt;/a&gt;] of type element or character 

   On Attribute Information Items in the property value:

      [namespace name]

      [local name]

      [normalized value]

   On Character Information Items in the property value:

      [character code]

   Since prefixes are used in some XML vocabularies (XPath and XML
   Schema, for example), servers SHOULD preserve, for any Information
   Item in the value:

      [&lt;a id=&quot;ref-prefix&quot; name=&quot;ref-prefix&quot;&gt;prefix&lt;/a&gt;]

   XML Infoset attributes not listed above MAY be preserved by the
   server, but clients MUST NOT rely on them being preserved.  The above
   rules would also apply by default to live properties, unless defined
   otherwise.

   Servers MUST ignore the XML attribute xml:space if present and never
   use it to change whitespace handling.  Whitespace in property values
   is significant.</source>

          <source>There are certain aspects of the HTTP Authentication Framework that
   put constraints on how new authentication schemes can work:

   o  HTTP authentication is presumed to be stateless: all of the
      information necessary to authenticate a request MUST be provided
      in the request, rather than be dependent on the server remembering
      prior requests.  Authentication based on, or bound to, the
      underlying connection is outside the scope of this specification
      and inherently flawed unless steps are taken to ensure that the
      connection cannot be used by any party other than the
      authenticated user (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-2.3&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;2.3 of [RFC7230]&lt;/a&gt;).

   o  The authentication parameter &quot;realm&quot; is reserved for defining
      protection spaces as described in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-2.2&quot;&gt;Section 2.2&lt;/a&gt;.  New schemes MUST
      NOT use it in a way incompatible with that definition.

   o  The &quot;token68&quot; notation was introduced for compatibility with
      existing authentication schemes and can only be used once per
      challenge or credential.  Thus, new schemes ought to use the
      auth-param syntax instead, because otherwise future extensions
      will be impossible.

   o  The parsing of challenges and credentials is defined by this
      specification and cannot be modified by new authentication
      schemes.  When the auth-param syntax is used, all parameters ought
      to support both token and quoted-string syntax, and syntactical
      constraints ought to be defined on the field value after parsing
      (i.e., quoted-string processing).  This is necessary so that
      recipients can use a generic parser that applies to all
      authentication schemes.

      Note: The fact that the value syntax for the &quot;realm&quot; parameter is
      restricted to quoted-string was a bad design choice not to be
      repeated for new parameters.

   o  Definitions of new schemes ought to define the treatment of
      unknown extension parameters.  In general, a &quot;must-ignore&quot; rule is
      preferable to a &quot;must-understand&quot; rule, because otherwise it will
      be hard to introduce new parameters in the presence of legacy
      recipients.  Furthermore, it's good to describe the policy for
      defining new parameters (such as &quot;update the specification&quot; or
      &quot;use this registry&quot;).

   o  Authentication schemes need to document whether they are usable in
      origin-server authentication (i.e., using WWW-Authenticate),
      and/or proxy authentication (i.e., using Proxy-Authenticate). 

   o  The credentials carried in an Authorization header field are
      specific to the user agent and, therefore, have the same effect on
      HTTP caches as the &quot;private&quot; Cache-Control response directive
      (&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.2.2.6&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;5.2.2.6 of [RFC7234]&lt;/a&gt;), within the scope of the request in
      which they appear.

      Therefore, new authentication schemes that choose not to carry
      credentials in the Authorization header field (e.g., using a newly
      defined header field) will need to explicitly disallow caching, by
      mandating the use of either Cache-Control request directives
      (e.g., &quot;no-store&quot;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234#section-5.2.1.5&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;5.2.1.5 of [RFC7234]&lt;/a&gt;) or response
      directives (e.g., &quot;private&quot;).</source>

          <source>There are two entity-tag comparison functions, depending on whether
   or not the comparison context allows the use of weak validators:

   o  Strong comparison: two entity-tags are equivalent if both are not

   o  Weak comparison: two entity-tags are equivalent if their

          <source>There are two kinds of collection write locks.  A depth-0 write lock
   on a collection protects the collection properties plus the internal
   member URLs of that one collection, while not protecting the content
   or properties of member resources (if the collection itself has any
   entity bodies, those are also protected).  A depth-infinity write
   lock on a collection provides the same protection on that collection
   and also provides write lock protection on every member resource.

   Expressed otherwise, a write lock of either kind protects any request
   that would create a new resource in a write locked collection, any
   request that would remove an internal member URL of a write locked
   collection, and any request that would change the segment name of any
   internal member.

   Thus, a collection write lock protects all the following actions:

   o  DELETE a collection's direct internal member, 

   o  MOVE an internal member out of the collection,

   o  MOVE an internal member into the collection,

   o  MOVE to rename an internal member within a collection,

   o  COPY an internal member into a collection, and

   o  PUT or MKCOL request that would create a new internal member.

   The collection's lock token is required in addition to the lock token
   on the internal member itself, if it is locked separately.

   In addition, a depth-infinity lock affects all write operations to
   all members of the locked collection.  With a depth-infinity lock,
   the resource identified by the root of the lock is directly locked,
   and all its members are indirectly locked.

   o  Any new resource added as a descendant of a depth-infinity locked
      collection becomes indirectly locked.

   o  Any indirectly locked resource moved out of the locked collection
      into an unlocked collection is thereafter unlocked.

   o  Any indirectly locked resource moved out of a locked source
      collection into a depth-infinity locked target collection remains
      indirectly locked but is now protected by the lock on the target
      collection (the target collection's lock token will thereafter be
      required to make further changes).

   If a depth-infinity write LOCK request is issued to a collection
   containing member URLs identifying resources that are currently
   locked in a manner that conflicts with the new lock (see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-6.1&quot;&gt;Section 6.1&lt;/a&gt;,
   point 3), the request MUST fail with a 423 (Locked) status code, and
   the response SHOULD contain the 'no-conflicting-lock' precondition.

   If a lock request causes the URL of a resource to be added as an
   internal member URL of a depth-infinity locked collection, then the
   new resource MUST be automatically protected by the lock.  For
   example, if the collection /a/b/ is write locked and the resource /c
   is moved to /a/b/c, then resource /a/b/c will be added to the write
   lock.</source>

          <source>There may be cases where a client wishes to submit state tokens, but
   doesn't want the request to fail just because the state token isn't
   current anymore.  One simple way to do this is to include a Condition
   that is known to always evaluate to true, such as in:

     If: (&amp;lt;urn:uuid:181d4fae-7d8c-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf2&amp;gt;)
       (Not &amp;lt;DAV:no-lock&amp;gt;)

   &quot;DAV:no-lock&quot; is known to never represent a current lock token.  Lock
   tokens are assigned by the server, following the uniqueness
   requirements described in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-6.5&quot;&gt;Section 6.5&lt;/a&gt;, therefore cannot use the
   &quot;DAV:&quot; scheme.  Thus, by applying &quot;Not&quot; to a state token that is 

   known not to be current, the Condition always evaluates to true.
   Consequently, the whole If header will always evaluate to true, and
   the lock token urn:uuid:181d4fae-7d8c-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf2 will be
   submitted in any case.</source>

   codes, servers MUST NOT send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 client

   A client MUST be prepared to accept one or more 1xx status responses
   prior to a regular response, even if the client does not expect a 100
   (Continue) status message. Unexpected 1xx status responses MAY be
   ignored by a user agent.

   Proxies MUST forward 1xx responses, unless the connection between the
   proxy and its client has been closed, or unless the proxy itself
   requested the generation of the 1xx response. (For example, if a 

   proxy adds a &quot;Expect: 100-continue&quot; field when it forwards a request,
   then it need not forward the corresponding 100 (Continue)
   response(s).)</source>

          <source>This document describes an extension to the HTTP/1.1 protocol that
   allows clients to perform remote Web content authoring operations.
   This extension provides a coherent set of methods, headers, request
   entity body formats, and response entity body formats that provide
   operations for:

   Properties: The ability to create, remove, and query information
   about Web pages, such as their authors, creation dates, etc.

   Collections: The ability to create sets of documents and to retrieve
   a hierarchical membership listing (like a directory listing in a file
   system).

   Locking: The ability to keep more than one person from working on a
   document at the same time.  This prevents the &quot;lost update problem&quot;,
   in which modifications are lost as first one author, then another,
   writes changes without merging the other author's changes.

   Namespace Operations: The ability to instruct the server to copy and
   move Web resources, operations that change the mapping from URLs to
   resources.

   Requirements and rationale for these operations are described in a
   companion document, &quot;Requirements for a Distributed Authoring and
   Versioning Protocol for the World Wide Web&quot; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2291&quot;&gt;RFC2291&lt;/a&gt;].

   This document does not specify the versioning operations suggested by
   [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2291&quot;&gt;RFC2291&lt;/a&gt;].  That work was done in a separate document, &quot;Versioning
   Extensions to WebDAV&quot; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3253&quot;&gt;RFC3253&lt;/a&gt;].

   The sections below provide a detailed introduction to various WebDAV
   abstractions: resource properties (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-4&quot;&gt;Section 4&lt;/a&gt;), collections of
   resources (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-5&quot;&gt;Section 5&lt;/a&gt;), locks (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-6&quot;&gt;Section 6&lt;/a&gt;) in general, and write locks
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-7&quot;&gt;Section 7&lt;/a&gt;) specifically.

   These abstractions are manipulated by the WebDAV-specific HTTP
   methods (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-9&quot;&gt;Section 9&lt;/a&gt;) and the extra HTTP headers (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-10&quot;&gt;Section 10&lt;/a&gt;) used with
   WebDAV methods.  General considerations for handling HTTP requests
   and responses in WebDAV are found in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-8&quot;&gt;Section 8&lt;/a&gt;.

   While the status codes provided by HTTP/1.1 are sufficient to
   describe most error conditions encountered by WebDAV methods, there
   are some errors that do not fall neatly into the existing categories.
   This specification defines extra status codes developed for WebDAV
   methods (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-11&quot;&gt;Section 11&lt;/a&gt;) and describes existing HTTP status codes
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-12&quot;&gt;Section 12&lt;/a&gt;) as used in WebDAV.  Since some WebDAV methods may 

   operate over many resources, the Multi-Status response (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-13&quot;&gt;Section 13&lt;/a&gt;)
   has been introduced to return status information for multiple
   resources.  Finally, this version of WebDAV introduces precondition
   and postcondition (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-16&quot;&gt;Section 16&lt;/a&gt;) XML elements in error response bodies.

   WebDAV uses XML ([&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-REC-XML&quot;&gt;REC-XML&lt;/a&gt;]) for property names and some values, and
   also uses XML to marshal complicated requests and responses.  This
   specification contains DTD and text definitions of all properties
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-15&quot;&gt;Section 15&lt;/a&gt;) and all other XML elements (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14&quot;&gt;Section 14&lt;/a&gt;) used in
   marshalling.  WebDAV includes a few special rules on extending WebDAV
   XML marshalling in backwards-compatible ways (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-17&quot;&gt;Section 17&lt;/a&gt;).

   Finishing off the specification are sections on what it means for a
   resource to be compliant with this specification (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-18&quot;&gt;Section 18&lt;/a&gt;), on
   internationalization support (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-19&quot;&gt;Section 19&lt;/a&gt;), and on security
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-20&quot;&gt;Section 20&lt;/a&gt;).</source>

          <source>This evolution of HTTP proves its extensibility and simplicity, liberating creation of many applications and compelling the adoption of the protocol. The environment in which HTTP is used today is quite different from that seen in the early 1990s. HTTP's original design proved to be a masterpiece, allowing the Web to evolve over a quarter of a century, without the need of a mutiny. By healing flaws, yet retaining the flexibility and extensibility which made HTTP such a success, the adoption of HTTP/2 hints at a bright future for the protocol.</source>

          <source>This section describes the semantics specific to the write lock type.
   The write lock is a specific instance of a lock type, and is the only
   lock type described in this specification.

   An exclusive write lock protects a resource: it prevents changes by
   any principal other than the lock creator and in any case where the
   lock token is not submitted (e.g., by a client process other than the
   one holding the lock).

   Clients MUST submit a lock-token they are authorized to use in any
   request that modifies a write-locked resource.  The list of
   modifications covered by a write-lock include:

   1.  A change to any of the following aspects of any write-locked
       resource:

       *  any variant,

       *  any dead property,

       *  any live property that is lockable (a live property is
          lockable unless otherwise defined.)

   2.  For collections, any modification of an internal member URI.  An
       internal member URI of a collection is considered to be modified
       if it is added, removed, or identifies a different resource.
       More discussion on write locks and collections is found in
       &lt;a href=&quot;#section-7.4&quot;&gt;Section 7.4&lt;/a&gt;.

   3.  A modification of the mapping of the root of the write lock,
       either to another resource or to no resource (e.g., DELETE).

   Of the methods defined in HTTP and WebDAV, PUT, POST, PROPPATCH,
   LOCK, UNLOCK, MOVE, COPY (for the destination resource), DELETE, and
   MKCOL are affected by write locks.  All other HTTP/WebDAV methods
   defined so far -- GET in particular -- function independently of a
   write lock.

   The next few sections describe in more specific terms how write locks
   interact with various operations.</source>

          <source>This section is meant to inform developers, information providers,
   and users of known security concerns relevant to HTTP semantics and
   its use for transferring information over the Internet.
   Considerations related to message syntax, parsing, and routing are

   The list of considerations below is not exhaustive.  Most security
   concerns related to HTTP semantics are about securing server-side
   applications (code behind the HTTP interface), securing user agent 

   processing of payloads received via HTTP, or secure use of the
   Internet in general, rather than security of the protocol.  Various

   Furthermore, it is limited to security considerations regarding the
   authentication framework, in general, rather than discussing all of
   the potential considerations for specific authentication schemes
   (which ought to be documented in the specifications that define those
   schemes).  Various organizations maintain topical information and

          <source>This section is meant to inform developers, information providers,
   and users of known security concerns specific to HTTP caching.  More
   general security considerations are addressed in HTTP messaging
   [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230&quot;&gt;RFC7230&lt;/a&gt;] and semantics [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231&quot;&gt;RFC7231&lt;/a&gt;].

   Caches expose additional potential vulnerabilities, since the
   contents of the cache represent an attractive target for malicious
   exploitation.  Because cache contents persist after an HTTP request
   is complete, an attack on the cache can reveal information long after
   a user believes that the information has been removed from the
   network.  Therefore, cache contents need to be protected as sensitive
   information.

   In particular, various attacks might be amplified by being stored in
   a shared cache; such &quot;cache poisoning&quot; attacks use the cache to
   distribute a malicious payload to many clients, and are especially
   effective when an attacker can use implementation flaws, elevated
   privileges, or other techniques to insert such a response into a
   cache.  One common attack vector for cache poisoning is to exploit
   differences in message parsing on proxies and in user agents; see
   &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.3&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;3.3.3 of [RFC7230]&lt;/a&gt; for the relevant requirements.

   Likewise, implementation flaws (as well as misunderstanding of cache
   operation) might lead to caching of sensitive information (e.g.,
   authentication credentials) that is thought to be private, exposing
   it to unauthorized parties. 

   Furthermore, the very use of a cache can bring about privacy
   concerns.  For example, if two users share a cache, and the first one
   browses to a site, the second may be able to detect that the other
   has been to that site, because the resources from it load more
   quickly, thanks to the cache.

   Note that the Set-Cookie response header field [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265&quot;&gt;RFC6265&lt;/a&gt;] does not
   inhibit caching; a cacheable response with a Set-Cookie header field
   can be (and often is) used to satisfy subsequent requests to caches.
   Servers who wish to control caching of these responses are encouraged
   to emit appropriate Cache-Control response header fields.</source>

          <source>This section is meant to inform developers, information providers,
   and users of known security concerns specific to the HTTP conditional
   request mechanisms.  More general security considerations are
   addressed in HTTP &quot;Message Syntax and Routing&quot; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230&quot;&gt;RFC7230&lt;/a&gt;] and
   &quot;Semantics and Content&quot; [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231&quot;&gt;RFC7231&lt;/a&gt;]. 

   The validators defined by this specification are not intended to
   ensure the validity of a representation, guard against malicious
   changes, or detect man-in-the-middle attacks.  At best, they enable
   more efficient cache updates and optimistic concurrent writes when
   all participants are behaving nicely.  At worst, the conditions will
   fail and the client will receive a response that is no more harmful
   than an HTTP exchange without conditional requests.

   An entity-tag can be abused in ways that create privacy risks.  For
   example, a site might deliberately construct a semantically invalid
   entity-tag that is unique to the user or user agent, send it in a
   cacheable response with a long freshness time, and then read that
   entity-tag in later conditional requests as a means of re-identifying
   that user or user agent.  Such an identifying tag would become a
   persistent identifier for as long as the user agent retained the
   original cache entry.  User agents that cache representations ought
   to ensure that the cache is cleared or replaced whenever the user
   performs privacy-maintaining actions, such as clearing stored cookies
   or changing to a private browsing mode.</source>

          <source>This section provides a concise model for how locking behaves.  Later
   sections will provide more detail on some of the concepts and refer
   back to these model statements.  Normative statements related to LOCK
   and UNLOCK method handling can be found in the sections on those
   methods, whereas normative statements that cover any method are
   gathered here.

   1.  A lock either directly or indirectly locks a resource.

   2.  A resource becomes directly locked when a LOCK request to a URL
       of that resource creates a new lock.  The &quot;lock-root&quot; of the new
       lock is that URL.  If at the time of the request, the URL is not
       mapped to a resource, a new empty resource is created and
       directly locked.

   3.  An exclusive lock (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-6.2&quot;&gt;Section 6.2&lt;/a&gt;) conflicts with any other kind of
       lock on the same resource, whether either lock is direct or
       indirect.  A server MUST NOT create conflicting locks on a
       resource.

   4.  For a collection that is locked with a depth-infinity lock L, all
       member resources are indirectly locked.  Changes in membership of
       such a collection affect the set of indirectly locked resources:

       *  If a member resource is added to the collection, the new
          member resource MUST NOT already have a conflicting lock,
          because the new resource MUST become indirectly locked by L.

       *  If a member resource stops being a member of the collection,
          then the resource MUST no longer be indirectly locked by L.

   5.  Each lock is identified by a single globally unique lock token
       (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-6.5&quot;&gt;Section 6.5&lt;/a&gt;).

   6.  An UNLOCK request deletes the lock with the specified lock token.
       After a lock is deleted, no resource is locked by that lock.

   7.  A lock token is &quot;submitted&quot; in a request when it appears in an
       &quot;If&quot; header (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-7&quot;&gt;Section 7&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Write Lock&quot;, discusses when token
       submission is required for write locks).

   8.  If a request causes the lock-root of any lock to become an
       unmapped URL, then the lock MUST also be deleted by that request.</source>

          <source>This specification defines two kinds of documents -- Category
   Documents and Service Documents.

   A Category Document (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-7&quot;&gt;Section 7&lt;/a&gt;) contains lists of categories
   specified using the &quot;atom:category&quot; element from the Atom Syndication
   Format (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287#section-4.2.2&quot;&gt;Section&amp;nbsp;4.2.2 of [RFC4287]&lt;/a&gt;).

   A Service Document (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-8&quot;&gt;Section 8&lt;/a&gt;) groups available Collections into
   Workspaces.

   The namespace name [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-REC-xml-names&quot;&gt;REC-xml-names&lt;/a&gt;] for either kind of document is:

       &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2007/app&quot;&gt;http://www.w3.org/2007/app&lt;/a&gt;

   Atom Publishing Protocol XML Documents MUST be &quot;namespace-well-
   formed&quot; as specified in Section 7 of [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-REC-xml-names&quot;&gt;REC-xml-names&lt;/a&gt;].

   This specification uses the prefix &quot;app:&quot; for the namespace name.
   The prefix &quot;atom:&quot; is used for &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom&quot;&gt;http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom&lt;/a&gt;&quot;, the
   namespace name of the Atom Syndication Format [&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287&quot;&gt;RFC4287&lt;/a&gt;].  These
   namespace prefixes are not semantically significant.

   This specification does not define any DTDs for Atom Protocol
   formats, and hence does not require them to be &quot;valid&quot; in the sense
   used by [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-REC-xml&quot;&gt;REC-xml&lt;/a&gt;].</source>

          <source>This specification encourages the use of &quot;A Universally Unique
   Identifier (UUID) URN Namespace&quot; ([&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122&quot;&gt;RFC4122&lt;/a&gt;]) for lock tokens
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-6.5&quot;&gt;Section 6.5&lt;/a&gt;), in order to guarantee their uniqueness across space
   and time.  Version 1 UUIDs (defined in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-4&quot;&gt;Section 4&lt;/a&gt;) MAY contain a
   &quot;node&quot; field that &quot;consists of an IEEE 802 MAC address, usually the
   host address.  For systems with multiple IEEE addresses, any
   available one can be used&quot;.  Since a WebDAV server will issue many
   locks over its lifetime, the implication is that it may also be
   publicly exposing its IEEE 802 address.

   There are several risks associated with exposure of IEEE 802
   addresses.  Using the IEEE 802 address:

   o  It is possible to track the movement of hardware from subnet to
      subnet.

   o  It may be possible to identify the manufacturer of the hardware
      running a WebDAV server.

   o  It may be possible to determine the number of each type of
      computer running WebDAV.

   This risk only applies to host-address-based UUID versions.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4&quot;&gt;Section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4&quot;&gt;4 of [RFC4122]&lt;/a&gt; describes several other mechanisms for generating
   UUIDs that do not involve the host address and therefore do not
   suffer from this risk.</source>

          <source>This specification has been carefully audited to correct and
   disambiguate key word usage; &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068&quot;&gt;RFC 2068&lt;/a&gt; had many problems in respect to
   the conventions laid out in &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119&quot;&gt;RFC 2119&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-34&quot;&gt;34&lt;/a&gt;].

   Clarified which error code should be used for inbound server failures
   (e.g. DNS failures). (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-10.5.5&quot;&gt;Section 10.5.5&lt;/a&gt;). 

   CREATE had a race that required an Etag be sent when a resource is
   first created. (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-10.2.2&quot;&gt;Section 10.2.2&lt;/a&gt;).

   Content-Base was deleted from the specification: it was not
   implemented widely, and there is no simple, safe way to introduce it
   without a robust extension mechanism. In addition, it is used in a
   similar, but not identical fashion in MHTML [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-45&quot;&gt;45&lt;/a&gt;].

   Transfer-coding and message lengths all interact in ways that
   required fixing exactly when chunked encoding is used (to allow for
   transfer encoding that may not be self delimiting); it was important
   to straighten out exactly how message lengths are computed. (Sections
   3.6, 4.4, 7.2.2, 13.5.2, 14.13, 14.16)

   A content-coding of &quot;identity&quot; was introduced, to solve problems
   discovered in caching. (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.5&quot;&gt;section 3.5&lt;/a&gt;)

   Quality Values of zero should indicate that &quot;I don't want something&quot;
   to allow clients to refuse a representation. (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.9&quot;&gt;Section 3.9&lt;/a&gt;)

   The use and interpretation of HTTP version numbers has been clarified
   by &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2145&quot;&gt;RFC 2145&lt;/a&gt;. Require proxies to upgrade requests to highest protocol
   version they support to deal with problems discovered in HTTP/1.0
   implementations (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.1&quot;&gt;Section 3.1&lt;/a&gt;)

   Charset wildcarding is introduced to avoid explosion of character set
   names in accept headers. (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.2&quot;&gt;Section 14.2&lt;/a&gt;)

   A case was missed in the Cache-Control model of HTTP/1.1; s-maxage
   was introduced to add this missing case. (Sections &lt;a href=&quot;#section-13.4&quot;&gt;13.4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.8&quot;&gt;14.8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.9&quot;&gt;14.9&lt;/a&gt;,
   14.9.3)

   The Cache-Control: max-age directive was not properly defined for
   responses. (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.9.3&quot;&gt;Section 14.9.3&lt;/a&gt;)

   There are situations where a server (especially a proxy) does not
   know the full length of a response but is capable of serving a
   byterange request. We therefore need a mechanism to allow byteranges
   with a content-range not indicating the full length of the message.
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-14.16&quot;&gt;Section 14.16&lt;/a&gt;)

   Range request responses would become very verbose if all meta-data
   were always returned; by allowing the server to only send needed
   headers in a 206 response, this problem can be avoided. (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-10.2.7&quot;&gt;Section&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#section-10.2.7&quot;&gt;10.2.7&lt;/a&gt;, 13.5.3, and 14.27) 

   Fix problem with unsatisfiable range requests; there are two cases:
   syntactic problems, and range doesn't exist in the document. The 416
   status code was needed to resolve this ambiguity needed to indicate
   an error for a byte range request that falls outside of the actual
   contents of a document. (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-10.4.17&quot;&gt;Section 10.4.17&lt;/a&gt;, 14.16)

   Rewrite of message transmission requirements to make it much harder
   for implementors to get it wrong, as the consequences of errors here
   can have significant impact on the Internet, and to deal with the
   following problems:

      1. Changing &quot;HTTP/1.1 or later&quot; to &quot;HTTP/1.1&quot;, in contexts where
         this was incorrectly placing a requirement on the behavior of
         an implementation of a future version of HTTP/1.x

      2. Made it clear that user-agents should retry requests, not
         &quot;clients&quot; in general.

      3. Converted requirements for clients to ignore unexpected 100
         (Continue) responses, and for proxies to forward 100 responses,
         into a general requirement for 1xx responses.

      4. Modified some TCP-specific language, to make it clearer that
         non-TCP transports are possible for HTTP.

      5. Require that the origin server MUST NOT wait for the request
         body before it sends a required 100 (Continue) response.

      6. Allow, rather than require, a server to omit 100 (Continue) if
         it has already seen some of the request body.

      7. Allow servers to defend against denial-of-service attacks and
         broken clients.

   This change adds the Expect header and 417 status code. The message
   transmission requirements fixes are in sections &lt;a href=&quot;#section-8.2&quot;&gt;8.2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#section-10.4.18&quot;&gt;10.4.18&lt;/a&gt;,
   8.1.2.2, 13.11, and 14.20.

   Proxies should be able to add Content-Length when appropriate.
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-13.5.2&quot;&gt;Section 13.5.2&lt;/a&gt;)

   Clean up confusion between 403 and 404 responses. (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-10.4.4&quot;&gt;Section 10.4.4&lt;/a&gt;,
   10.4.5, and 10.4.11)

   Warnings could be cached incorrectly, or not updated appropriately.
   (&lt;a href=&quot;#section-13.1.2&quot;&gt;Section 13.1.2&lt;/a&gt;, 13.2.4, 13.5.2, 13.5.3, 14.9.3, and 14.46) Warning
   also needed to be a general header, as PUT or other methods may have
   need for it in requests. 

   Transfer-coding had significant problems, particularly with
   interactions with chunked encoding. The solution is that transfer-
   codings become as full fledged as content-codings. This involves
   adding an IANA registry for transfer-codings (separate from content
   codings), a new header field (TE) and enabling trailer headers in the
   future. Transfer encoding is a major performance benefit, so it was
   worth fixing [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-39&quot;&gt;39&lt;/a&gt;]. TE also solves another, obscure, downward
   interoperability problem that could have occurred due to interactions
   between authentication trailers, chunked encoding and HTTP/1.0
   clients.(&lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.6&quot;&gt;Section 3.6&lt;/a&gt;, 3.6.1, and 14.39)

   The PATCH, LINK, UNLINK methods were defined but not commonly
   implemented in previous versions of this specification. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068&quot;&gt;RFC 2068&lt;/a&gt;
   [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-33&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;].

   The Alternates, Content-Version, Derived-From, Link, URI, Public and
   Content-Base header fields were defined in previous versions of this
   specification, but not commonly implemented. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2068&quot;&gt;RFC 2068&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-33&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;].</source>

          <source>This specification makes heavy use of the augmented BNF and generic
   constructs defined by David H. Crocker for &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822&quot;&gt;RFC 822&lt;/a&gt; [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;]. Similarly, it
   reuses many of the definitions provided by Nathaniel Borenstein and
   Ned Freed for MIME [&lt;a href=&quot;#ref-7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;]. We hope that their inclusion in this
   specification will help reduce past confusion over the relationship
   between HTTP and Internet mail message formats.

   The HTTP protocol has evolved considerably over the years. It has
   benefited from a large and active developer community--the many
   people who have participated on the www-talk mailing list--and it is
   that community which has been most responsible for the success of
   HTTP and of the World-Wide Web in general. Marc Andreessen, Robert
   Cailliau, Daniel W. Connolly, Bob Denny, John Franks, Jean-Francois
   Groff, Phillip M. Hallam-Baker, Hakon W. Lie, Ari Luotonen, Rob
   McCool, Lou Montulli, Dave Raggett, Tony Sanders, and Marc
   VanHeyningen deserve special recognition for their efforts in
   defining early aspects of the protocol.

          <source>This specification targets conformance criteria according to the role
   of a participant in HTTP communication.  Hence, HTTP requirements are
   placed on senders, recipients, clients, servers, user agents,
   intermediaries, origin servers, proxies, gateways, or caches,
   depending on what behavior is being constrained by the requirement.
   Additional (social) requirements are placed on implementations,
   resource owners, and protocol element registrations when they apply
   beyond the scope of a single communication.

   The verb &quot;generate&quot; is used instead of &quot;send&quot; where a requirement
   differentiates between creating a protocol element and merely
   forwarding a received element downstream.

   An implementation is considered conformant if it complies with all of
   the requirements associated with the roles it partakes in HTTP.

   Conformance includes both the syntax and semantics of protocol
   elements.  A sender MUST NOT generate protocol elements that convey a
   meaning that is known by that sender to be false.  A sender MUST NOT
   generate protocol elements that do not match the grammar defined by
   the corresponding ABNF rules.  Within a given message, a sender MUST
   NOT generate protocol elements or syntax alternatives that are only
   allowed to be generated by participants in other roles (i.e., a role
   that the sender does not have for that message).

   When a received protocol element is parsed, the recipient MUST be
   able to parse any value of reasonable length that is applicable to
   the recipient's role and that matches the grammar defined by the
   corresponding ABNF rules.  Note, however, that some received protocol
   elements might not be parsed.  For example, an intermediary 

   forwarding a message might parse a header-field into generic
   field-name and field-value components, but then forward the header
   field without further parsing inside the field-value.

   HTTP does not have specific length limitations for many of its
   protocol elements because the lengths that might be appropriate will
   vary widely, depending on the deployment context and purpose of the
   implementation.  Hence, interoperability between senders and
   recipients depends on shared expectations regarding what is a
   reasonable length for each protocol element.  Furthermore, what is
   commonly understood to be a reasonable length for some protocol
   elements has changed over the course of the past two decades of HTTP
   use and is expected to continue changing in the future.

   At a minimum, a recipient MUST be able to parse and process protocol
   element lengths that are at least as long as the values that it
   generates for those same protocol elements in other messages.  For
   example, an origin server that publishes very long URI references to
   its own resources needs to be able to parse and process those same
   references when received as a request target.

   A recipient MUST interpret a received protocol element according to
   the semantics defined for it by this specification, including
   extensions to this specification, unless the recipient has determined
   (through experience or configuration) that the sender incorrectly
   implements what is implied by those semantics.  For example, an
   origin server might disregard the contents of a received
   Accept-Encoding header field if inspection of the User-Agent header
   field indicates a specific implementation version that is known to
   fail on receipt of certain content codings.

   Unless noted otherwise, a recipient MAY attempt to recover a usable
   protocol element from an invalid construct.  HTTP does not define
   specific error handling mechanisms except when they have a direct
   impact on security, since different applications of the protocol
   require different error handling strategies.  For example, a Web
   browser might wish to transparently recover from a response where the
   Location header field doesn't parse according to the ABNF, whereas a
   systems control client might consider any form of error recovery to
   be dangerous.</source>

          <source>This specification uses a number of terms to refer to the roles
   played by participants in, and objects of, the HTTP communication.

   connection
      A transport layer virtual circuit established between two programs
      for the purpose of communication.

   message
      The basic unit of HTTP communication, consisting of a structured
      sequence of octets matching the syntax defined in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-4&quot;&gt;section 4&lt;/a&gt; and
      transmitted via the connection.

   request
      An HTTP request message, as defined in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-5&quot;&gt;section 5&lt;/a&gt;.

   response
      An HTTP response message, as defined in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-6&quot;&gt;section 6&lt;/a&gt;. 

   resource
      A network data object or service that can be identified by a URI,
      as defined in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-3.2&quot;&gt;section 3.2&lt;/a&gt;. Resources may be available in multiple
      representations (e.g. multiple languages, data formats, size, and
      resolutions) or vary in other ways.

   entity
      The information transferred as the payload of a request or
      response. An entity consists of metainformation in the form of
      entity-header fields and content in the form of an entity-body, as
      described in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-7&quot;&gt;section 7&lt;/a&gt;.

   representation
      An entity included with a response that is subject to content
      negotiation, as described in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-12&quot;&gt;section 12&lt;/a&gt;. There may exist multiple
      representations associated with a particular response status.

   content negotiation
      The mechanism for selecting the appropriate representation when
      servicing a request, as described in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-12&quot;&gt;section 12&lt;/a&gt;. The
      representation of entities in any response can be negotiated
      (including error responses).

   variant
      A resource may have one, or more than one, representation(s)
      associated with it at any given instant. Each of these
      representations is termed a `varriant'.  Use of the term `variant'
      does not necessarily imply that the resource is subject to content
      negotiation.

   client
      A program that establishes connections for the purpose of sending
      requests.

   user agent
      The client which initiates a request. These are often browsers,
      editors, spiders (web-traversing robots), or other end user tools.

   server
      An application program that accepts connections in order to
      service requests by sending back responses. Any given program may
      be capable of being both a client and a server; our use of these
      terms refers only to the role being performed by the program for a
      particular connection, rather than to the program's capabilities
      in general. Likewise, any server may act as an origin server,
      proxy, gateway, or tunnel, switching behavior based on the nature
      of each request. 

   origin server
      The server on which a given resource resides or is to be created.

   proxy
      An intermediary program which acts as both a server and a client
      for the purpose of making requests on behalf of other clients.
      Requests are serviced internally or by passing them on, with
      possible translation, to other servers. A proxy MUST implement
      both the client and server requirements of this specification. A
      &quot;transparent proxy&quot; is a proxy that does not modify the request or
      response beyond what is required for proxy authentication and
      identification. A &quot;non-transparent proxy&quot; is a proxy that modifies
      the request or response in order to provide some added service to
      the user agent, such as group annotation services, media type
      transformation, protocol reduction, or anonymity filtering. Except
      where either transparent or non-transparent behavior is explicitly
      stated, the HTTP proxy requirements apply to both types of
      proxies.

   gateway
      A server which acts as an intermediary for some other server.
      Unlike a proxy, a gateway receives requests as if it were the
      origin server for the requested resource; the requesting client
      may not be aware that it is communicating with a gateway.

   tunnel
      An intermediary program which is acting as a blind relay between
      two connections. Once active, a tunnel is not considered a party
      to the HTTP communication, though the tunnel may have been
      initiated by an HTTP request. The tunnel ceases to exist when both
      ends of the relayed connections are closed.

   cache
      A program's local store of response messages and the subsystem
      that controls its message storage, retrieval, and deletion. A
      cache stores cacheable responses in order to reduce the response
      time and network bandwidth consumption on future, equivalent
      requests. Any client or server may include a cache, though a cache
      cannot be used by a server that is acting as a tunnel.

   cacheable
      A response is cacheable if a cache is allowed to store a copy of
      the response message for use in answering subsequent requests. The
      rules for determining the cacheability of HTTP responses are
      defined in &lt;a href=&quot;#section-13&quot;&gt;section 13&lt;/a&gt;. Even if a resource is cacheable, there may
      be additional constraints on whether a cache can use the cached
      copy for a particular request. 

   first-hand
      A response is first-hand if it comes directly and without
      unnecessary delay from the origin server, perhaps via one or more
      proxies. A response is also first-hand if its validity has just
      been checked directly with the origin server.

   explicit expiration time
      The time at which the origin server intends that an entity should
      no longer be returned by a cache without further validation.

   heuristic expiration time
      An expiration time assigned by a cache when no explicit expiration
      time is available.

   age
      The age of a response is the time since it was sent by, or
      successfully validated with, the origin server.

   freshness lifetime
      The length of time between the generation of a response and its
      expiration time.

   fresh
      A response is fresh if its age has not yet exceeded its freshness
      lifetime.

   stale
      A response is stale if its age has passed its freshness lifetime.

   semantically transparent
      A cache behaves in a &quot;semantically transparent&quot; manner, with
      respect to a particular response, when its use affects neither the
      requesting client nor the origin server, except to improve
      performance. When a cache is semantically transparent, the client
      receives exactly the same response (except for hop-by-hop headers)
      that it would have received had its request been handled directly
      by the origin server.

   validator
      A protocol element (e.g., an entity tag or a Last-Modified time)
      that is used to find out whether a cache entry is an equivalent
      copy of an entity.

   upstream/downstream
      Upstream and downstream describe the flow of a message: all
      messages flow from upstream to downstream. 

   inbound/outbound
      Inbound and outbound refer to the request and response paths for
      messages: &quot;inbound&quot; means &quot;traveling toward the origin server&quot;,
      and &quot;outbound&quot; means &quot;traveling toward the user agent&quot;</source>

          <source>This specification uses three rules to denote the use of linear
   whitespace: OWS (optional whitespace), RWS (required whitespace), and
   BWS (&quot;bad&quot; whitespace).

   The OWS rule is used where zero or more linear whitespace octets
   might appear.  For protocol elements where optional whitespace is
   preferred to improve readability, a sender SHOULD generate the
   optional whitespace as a single SP; otherwise, a sender SHOULD NOT
   generate optional whitespace except as needed to white out invalid or
   unwanted protocol elements during in-place message filtering.

   The RWS rule is used when at least one linear whitespace octet is
   required to separate field tokens.  A sender SHOULD generate RWS as a
   single SP.

   The BWS rule is used where the grammar allows optional whitespace
   only for historical reasons.  A sender MUST NOT generate BWS in
   messages.  A recipient MUST parse for such bad whitespace and remove
   it before interpreting the protocol element. 

     OWS            = *( SP / HTAB )
                    ; optional whitespace
     RWS            = 1*( SP / HTAB )

          <source>To add members to a Collection, clients send POST requests to the URI
   of the Collection.

   Successful member creation is indicated with a 201 (&quot;Created&quot;)
   response code.  When the Collection responds with a status code of
   201, it SHOULD also return a response body, which MUST be an Atom
   Entry Document representing the newly created Resource.  Since the
   server is free to alter the POSTed Entry, for example, by changing
   the content of the atom:id element, returning the Entry can be useful
   to the client, enabling it to correlate the client and server views
   of the new Entry.

   When a Member Resource is created, its Member Entry URI MUST be
   returned in a Location header in the Collection's response. 

   If the creation request contained an Atom Entry Document, and the
   subsequent response from the server contains a Content-Location
   header that matches the Location header character-for-character, then
   the client is authorized to interpret the response entity as being a
   complete representation of the newly created Entry.  Without a
   matching Content-Location header, the client MUST NOT assume the
   returned entity is a complete representation of the created Resource.

   The request body sent with the POST need not be an Atom Entry.  For
   example, it might be a picture or a movie.  Collections MAY return a
   response with a status code of 415 (&quot;Unsupported Media Type&quot;) to
   indicate that the media type of the POSTed entity is not allowed or
   supported by the Collection.  For a discussion of the issues in
   creating such content, see &lt;a href=&quot;#section-9.6&quot;&gt;Section 9.6&lt;/a&gt;.</source>
