This version is an almost complete rewrite of the original library to
use plugins to read/write specific formats. It also uses plugins to
read/write XML representations of the PDB. The default format is XML, but
it is possible to read/write other formats. If there is no plugin for the
database type you are converting, a basic one will be used. Currently
the plugins include Progect, Progect Project List and Palm TODO.
Work is continuing, and I hope to provide plugins for the standard
Palm databases, either written by other people or by myself over time.
&lt;em&gt;Any&lt;/em&gt; database will be converted to XML, but the application specific
data will remain opaque, by providing a plugin you can turn the opaque
data into something useful.</source>
