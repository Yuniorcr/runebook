          <source>Pmail implements a client/server pair. The server is supposed to be run in the
background (for example via a systemd service) and it serves two purposes.
First it is supposed to keep a local database containing information about the
users mailbox in sync with the remote version kept by Google.
Second, it handles all database related functionality for the client.
The advantage of this is it allows the use of a sqlite database
since concurrency issues can be handled between different threads of the same
program quite easily using Lock objects from pythons threading module.
The local database is not a full copy of the remote inbox, it only stores
information contained in the header fields of the emails (more or less).
If you want to read an email then it must be downloaded and so a network
connection is required.</source>

          <source>When a search is executed a list of matching messages is retrieved directly from
Google - not by querying the local database - and the corresponding message
information is added to the local database.
This is probably not ideal - it means if you do a search with a large amount of
matches it can be quite slow and it can cause your local database to grow quite
allot.
On the other hand if you want to increase the amount of historical messages with
information stored locally you can just do a search for 'newer_than:4y', where
'4y' is any time period you like.
The search is compatible with any keyword search exactly the same as the usual
Gmail searching capabilities and hence its quite powerful.</source>
