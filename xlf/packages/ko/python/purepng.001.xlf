          <source>PurePNG allows PNG image files to be read and written using pure Python.
PurePNG can read and write all PNG formats.
PNG supports a generous variety of image formats: RGB or greyscale, with or
without an alpha channel; and a choice of bit depths from 1, 2 or 4
(as long as you want greyscale or a pallete),
8, and 16 (but 16 bits is not allowed for palettes).
A pixel can vary in size from 1 to 64 bits: 1/2/4/8/16/24/32/48/64.
In addition a PNG file can be interlaced or not.
An interlaced file allows an incrementally refined display of images being
downloaded over slow links (yet it`s not implemented in PurePNG for now).</source>
