          <source>Panda3D is a modern engine supporting advanced features such as shaders,
stencil, and render-to-texture. Panda3D is unusual in that it emphasizes a
short learning curve, rapid development, and extreme stability and robustness.
Panda3D is free software that runs under Windows, Linux, or macOS.</source>

          <source>Panda3D is a powerful 3D engine written in C++, with a complete set of Python
bindings. Unlike other engines, these bindings are automatically generated,
meaning that they are always up-to-date and complete: all functions of the
engine can be controlled from Python. All major Panda3D applications have been
written in Python, this is the intended way of using the engine.</source>

          <source>Panda3D now supports automatic shader generation, which now means you can use
normal maps, gloss maps, glow maps, HDR, cartoon shading, and the like without
having to write any shaders.</source>

          <source>The Panda3D team is very concerned with making the engine accessible to new
users. We provide a detailed manual, a complete API reference, and a large
collection of sample programs to help you get started. We have active forums,
with many helpful users, and the developers are regularly online to answer
questions.</source>
