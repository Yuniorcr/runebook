          <source>The edit distance coefficients are normally read from the APPCOST table once and there after stored in memory. Hence, run-time changes to the APPCOST table will not normally affect the edit distance results. However, inserting the special string 'reset' into the &quot;command&quot; column of the virtual table causes the edit distance coefficients to be reread the APPCOST table. Hence, applications should run a SQL statement similar to the following when changes to the APPCOST table occur:</source>

          <source>The extra write overhead prompted a reexamination of assumptions about powersafe overwrite. With modern disk drives, the capacity has become so large and the data density so great that a single sector is very small and writing a single sector takes very little time. We know that disk drives can detect an impending power loss and continue to operate for some small amount of time on residual energy because those drives are able to park their heads before spinning down. And so if an impending power loss is detectable by the disk controller, it seems reasonable that the controller will finish writing whatever sector it is current working on when the imminent power loss is first detected, prior to parking the heads, as long as doing so does not take too long, which it should not with small and dense sectors. Hence it seems reasonable to assume powersafe overwrite for modern disks. Indeed, BerkeleyDB has made this assumption for decades, we are told. Caution is advised though. As Roger Binns noted on the SQLite developers mailing list: &quot;'poorly written' should be the main assumption about drive firmware.&quot;</source>

          <source>The first attempt at closing security gaps in pointer passing was to prevent pointer values from being forged. This was accomplished by having the sender attach a subtype to each pointer using &lt;a href=&quot;c3ref/result_subtype&quot;&gt;sqlite3_result_subtype()&lt;/a&gt; and having the receiver verify that subtype using &lt;a href=&quot;c3ref/value_subtype&quot;&gt;sqlite3_value_subtype()&lt;/a&gt; and reject pointers that had an incorrect subtype. Since there is no way to attach a subtype to a result using pure SQL, this prevents pointers from being forged using SQL. The only way to send a pointer is to use C code. If an attacker can set a subtype, then he is also able to forge a pointer without the help of SQLite.</source>

          <source>The general purpose memory allocator is the most difficult memory pool to manage because it supports allocations of varying sizes. Since &lt;b&gt;n&lt;/b&gt; is a multiplier on &lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt; we want to keep &lt;b&gt;n&lt;/b&gt; as small as possible.

To avoid confusion, always use the original Fossil hash, not the Git hash, when referring to SQLite check-ins.</source>

          <source>The inputs to TH3 are test modules written in C or SQL and small configuration files that determine how to initialize SQLite. The TH3 package includes 1,444 test modules and more than 47 configurations (as of 2018-05-19). New modules and configurations can be added to customize TH3 for specialized applications. Each time TH3 is run, it reads a subset of the available test modules and configuration files to generate a custom C program that performs all of the specified tests under all specified configurations. A complete test of SQLite normally involves running TH3 multiple times to generate multiple test programs covering different aspects of SQLite's operation, then linking all test programs against a common SQLite library and running them separately on the target platform.</source>

There is one exception to this rule though. If a parent key is not subject to a PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraint created as part of the parent table definition, but is subject to a UNIQUE constraint by virtue of an index created using the &lt;a href=&quot;lang_createindex&quot;&gt;CREATE INDEX&lt;/a&gt; command, then the child table may be populated without causing a &quot;foreign key mismatch&quot; error. If the UNIQUE index is dropped from the database schema, then the parent table itself is dropped, no error will be reported. However the database may be left in a state where the child table of the foreign key constraint contains rows that do not refer to any parent table row. This case can be avoided if all parent keys in the database schema are constrained by PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE constraints added as part of the parent table definition, not by external UNIQUE indexes.</source>

          <source>The internal organization of the SQLite library can be viewed as the stack of modules shown to the right. The Tokenizer, Parser, and Code Generator components are used to process SQL statements and convert them into executable programs in a virtual machine language or byte code. Roughly speaking, these top three layers implement &lt;a href=&quot;c3ref/prepare&quot;&gt;sqlite3_prepare_v2()&lt;/a&gt;. The byte code generated by the top three layers is a &lt;a href=&quot;c3ref/stmt&quot;&gt;prepared statement&lt;/a&gt;. The Virtual Machine module is responsible for running the SQL statement byte code. The B-Tree module organizes a database file into multiple key/value stores with ordered keys and logarithmic performance. The Pager module is responsible for loading pages of the database file into memory, for implementing and controlling transactions, and for creating and maintaining the journal files that prevent database corruption following a crash or power failure. The OS Interface is a thin abstraction that provides a common set of routines for adapting SQLite to run on different operating systems. Roughly speaking, the bottom four layers implement &lt;a href=&quot;c3ref/step&quot;&gt;sqlite3_step()&lt;/a&gt;.</source>

Thus, if one inserts &lt;b&gt;'1234'&lt;/b&gt; into an INTEGER column, that value is converted into an integer 1234 and stored. But, if you insert a non-numeric string like &lt;b&gt;'wxyz'&lt;/b&gt; into an INTEGER column, unlike other SQL databases, SQLite does not throw an error.

          <source>The last (fourth) bullet above merits additional comment. When SQLite creates a journal file on Unix, it opens the directory that contains that file and calls fsync() on the directory, in an effort to push the directory information to disk. But suppose some other process is adding or removing unrelated files to the directory that contains the database and journal at the moment of a power failure. The supposedly unrelated actions of this other process might result in the journal file being dropped from the directory and moved into &quot;lost+found&quot;. This is an unlikely scenario, but it could happen. The best defenses are to use a journaling filesystem or to keep the database and journal in a directory by themselves.</source>

          <source>The module-name is the name of an object that implements the virtual table. The module-name must be registered with the SQLite database connection using &lt;a href=&quot;c3ref/create_module&quot;&gt;sqlite3_create_module()&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;c3ref/create_module&quot;&gt;sqlite3_create_module_v2()&lt;/a&gt; prior to issuing the CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE statement. The module takes zero or more comma-separated arguments. The arguments can be just about any text as long as it has balanced parentheses. The argument syntax is sufficiently general that the arguments can be made to appear as &lt;a href=&quot;lang_createtable#tablecoldef&quot;&gt;column definitions&lt;/a&gt; in a traditional &lt;a href=&quot;lang_createtable&quot;&gt;CREATE TABLE&lt;/a&gt; statement. SQLite passes the module arguments directly to the &lt;a href=&quot;vtab#xcreate&quot;&gt;xCreate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;vtab#xconnect&quot;&gt;xConnect&lt;/a&gt; methods of the module implementation without any interpretation.

          <source>The most common way to force an SQLite database to exist purely in memory is to open the database using the special filename &quot;&lt;b&gt;:memory:&lt;/b&gt;&quot;.

          <source>The most efficient way to apply changes to a B-Tree (the data structure that SQLite uses to store each table and index on disk) is to make the changes in key order. But if an SQL table has one or more indexes, the key order for each index may be different from the main table and the other auxiliary indexes. As a result, when executing a series of &lt;a href=&quot;lang_insert&quot;&gt;INSERT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;lang_update&quot;&gt;UPDATE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;lang_delete&quot;&gt;DELETE&lt;/a&gt; statements it is not generally possible to order the operations so that all b-trees are updated in key order. The RBU update process works around this by applying all changes to the main table in one pass, then applying changes to each index in separate passes, ensuring each B-Tree is updated optimally. For a large database file (one that does not fit in the OS disk cache) this procedure can result in two orders of magnitude faster updates.</source>

          <source>The most useful thing about FTS tables is the queries that may be performed using the built-in full-text index. Full-text queries are performed by specifying a clause of the form &quot;&amp;lt;column&amp;gt; MATCH &amp;lt;full-text query expression&amp;gt;&quot; as part of the WHERE clause of a SELECT statement that reads data from an FTS table. &lt;a href=&quot;fts3#simple_fts_queries&quot;&gt;Simple FTS queries&lt;/a&gt; that return all documents that contain a given term are described above. In that discussion the right-hand operand of the MATCH operator was assumed to be a string consisting of a single term.

          <source>The new API for SQLite 3.0 contains routines that accept text as both UTF-8 and UTF-16 in the native byte order of the host machine. Each database file manages text as either UTF-8, UTF-16BE (big-endian), or UTF-16LE (little-endian). Internally and in the disk file, the same text representation is used everywhere. If the text representation specified by the database file (in the file header) does not match the text representation required by the interface routines, then text is converted on-the-fly. Constantly converting text from one representation to another can be computationally expensive, so it is suggested that programmers choose a single representation and stick with it throughout their application.</source>

          <source>The new file format omits unused fields from its disk images. For example, indices use only the key part of a B-tree record and not the data. So for indices, the field that records the length of the data is omitted. Integer values such as the length of key and data are stored using a variable-length encoding so that only one or two bytes are required to store the most common cases but up to 64-bits of information can be encoded if needed. Integer and floating point data is stored on the disk in binary rather than being converted into ASCII as in SQLite version 2.8. These changes taken together result in database files that are typically 25% to 35% smaller than the equivalent files in SQLite version 2.8.</source>

          <source>The only thing that is really new about the current example is the WHERE clause which is implemented by instructions at addresses 7 through 10. Instructions at address 7 and 8 push onto the stack the value of the &quot;one&quot; column from the table and the literal string &quot;H%&quot;. The &lt;a href=&quot;opcode#Function&quot;&gt;Function&lt;/a&gt; instruction at address 9 pops these two values from the stack and pushes the result of the LIKE() function back onto the stack. The &lt;a href=&quot;opcode#IfNot&quot;&gt;IfNot&lt;/a&gt; instruction pops the top stack value and causes an immediate jump forward to the Next instruction if the top value was false (&lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; not like the literal string &quot;H%&quot;). Taking this jump effectively skips the callback, which is the whole point of the WHERE clause. If the result of the comparison is true, the jump is not taken and control falls through to the Callback instruction below.</source>

          <source>The parsing of SQL statements is a significant consumer of CPU cycles in any SQL database engine. On-going efforts to optimize SQLite have caused the developers to spend a lot of time tweaking Lemon to generate faster parsers. These efforts have benefited all users of the Lemon parser generator, not just SQLite. But if Lemon had been a separately maintained tool, it would have been more difficulty to make coordinated changes to both SQLite and Lemon, and as a result not as much optimization would have been accomplished. Hence, the fact that the parser generator tool is included in the source tree for SQLite has turned out to be a net benefit for both the tool itself and for SQLite.</source>

To avoid denial-of-service attacks from miscreants who are able to specify their own LIKE or GLOB patterns, the length of the LIKE or GLOB pattern is limited to SQLITE_MAX_LIKE_PATTERN_LENGTH bytes. The default value of this limit is 50000. A modern workstation can evaluate even a pathological LIKE or GLOB pattern of 50000 bytes relatively quickly. The denial of service problem only comes into play when the pattern length gets into millions of bytes. Nevertheless, since most useful LIKE or GLOB patterns are at most a few dozen bytes in length, paranoid application developers may want to reduce this parameter to something in the range of a few hundred if they know that external users are able to generate arbitrary patterns.</source>

          <source>The performance difference arises (we believe) because when working from an SQLite database, the open() and close() system calls are invoked only once, whereas open() and close() are invoked once for each blob when using blobs stored in individual files. It appears that the overhead of calling open() and close() is greater than the overhead of using the database. The size reduction arises from the fact that individual files are padded out to the next multiple of the filesystem block size, whereas the blobs are packed more tightly into an SQLite database.</source>

          <source>The presentation of the query planner problem above is a simplification. The costs are estimates. We cannot know what the true cost of running a loop is until we actually run the loop. SQLite makes guesses for the cost of running a loop based on the availability of indexes and constraints found in the WHERE clause. These guesses are usually pretty good, but they can sometimes be off. Using the &lt;a href=&quot;lang_analyze&quot;&gt;ANALYZE&lt;/a&gt; command to collect additional statistical information about the database can sometimes enable SQLite to make better guesses about the cost.</source>

          <source>The previous paragraph states that SQLite does not assume that sector writes are atomic. This is true by default.

The &lt;a href=&quot;vfs&quot;&gt;VFS&lt;/a&gt; is the only means by which SQLite communicates to the underlying filesystem. The code comes with default VFS implementations for Unix and Windows and there is a mechanism for creating new custom VFS implementations at runtime. In this new VFS interface there is a method called xDeviceCharacteristics. This method interrogates the underlying filesystem to discover various properties and behaviors that the filesystem may or may not exhibit. The xDeviceCharacteristics method might indicate that sector writes are atomic, and if it does so indicate, SQLite will try to take advantage of that fact. But the default xDeviceCharacteristics method for both Unix and Windows does not indicate atomic sector writes and so these optimizations are normally omitted.</source>

          <source>The push-down optimization cannot always be used. For example, if the subquery contains a LIMIT, then pushing down any part of the WHERE clause from the outer query could change the result of the inner query. There are other restrictions, explained in a comment in the source code on the pushDownWhereTerms() routine that implements this optimization.</source>

          <source>The query above could be made to run faster by using the FTS &lt;a href=&quot;fts3#matchinfo&quot;&gt;matchinfo&lt;/a&gt; function to determine the number of query term instances that appear in each result. The matchinfo function is much more efficient than the offsets function. Furthermore, the matchinfo function provides extra information regarding the overall number of occurrences of each query term in the entire document set (not just the current row) and the number of documents in which each query term appears. This may be used (for example) to attach a higher weight to less common terms which may increase the overall computed relevancy of those results the user considers more interesting.</source>

          <source>The query planner in SQLite normally does a terrific job of selecting fast algorithms for running your SQL statements. This is true of the legacy query planner and even more true of the new NGQP. There may be an occasional situation where, due to incomplete information, the query planner selects a suboptimal plan. This will happen less often with the NGQP than with the legacy query planner, but it might still happen. Only in those rare cases do application developers need to get involved and help the query planner to do the right thing. In the common case, the NGQP is just a new enhancement to SQLite that makes the application run a little faster and which requires no new developer thought or action.</source>

However, the current tarball naming conventions only reserve two digits for the Y and so the naming format for downloads will need to be revised in about 2030.</source>

          <source>The reader algorithm in the previous paragraphs works correctly, but because frames for page P can appear anywhere within the WAL, the reader has to scan the entire WAL looking for page P frames. If the WAL is large (multiple megabytes is typical) that scan can be slow, and read performance suffers. To overcome this problem, a separate data structure called the wal-index is maintained to expedite the search for frames of a particular page.</source>

          <source>The reallocarray() interface is a recent innovation (circa 2014) from the OpenBSD community that grow out of efforts to prevent the next &lt;a href=&quot;http://heartbleed.com&quot;&gt;&quot;heartbleed&quot; bug&lt;/a&gt; by avoiding 32-bit integer arithmetic overflow on memory allocation size computations. The reallocarray() function has both unit-size and count parameters. To allocate memory sufficient to hold an array of N elements each X-bytes in size, one calls &quot;reallocarray(0,X,N)&quot;. This is preferred over the traditional technique of invoking &quot;malloc(X*N)&quot; as reallocarray() eliminates the risk that the X*N multiplication will overflow and cause malloc() to return a buffer that is a different size from what the application expected.</source>

          <source>The reason for this is easy to understand: When a document is inserted into the FTS5 table, an entry is added to the full-text index to record the position of each token within the new document. When a document is removed, the original data is required in order to determine the set of entries that need to be removed from the full-text index. So if the data supplied to FTS5 when a row is deleted using this command is different from that used to determine the set of token instances when it was inserted, some full-text index entries may not be correctly deleted, or FTS5 may try to remove index entries that do not exist. This can leave the full-text index in an unpredictable state, making future query results unreliable.</source>

          <source>The remaining fields of the &lt;a href=&quot;c3ref/vfs&quot;&gt;sqlite3_vfs&lt;/a&gt; object all store pointers to functions that implement primitive operations. We call these &quot;methods&quot;. The first method, xOpen, is used to open files on the underlying storage media. The result is an &lt;a href=&quot;c3ref/file&quot;&gt;sqlite3_file&lt;/a&gt; object. There are additional methods, defined by the &lt;a href=&quot;c3ref/file&quot;&gt;sqlite3_file&lt;/a&gt; object itself that are used to read and write and close the file. The additional methods are detailed below. The filename is in UTF-8. SQLite will guarantee that the zFilename string passed to xOpen() is a full pathname as generated by xFullPathname() and that the string will be valid and unchanged until xClose() is called. So the &lt;a href=&quot;c3ref/file&quot;&gt;sqlite3_file&lt;/a&gt; can store a pointer to the filename if it needs to remember the filename for some reason. The flags argument to xOpen() is a copy of the flags argument to sqlite3_open_v2(). If sqlite3_open() or sqlite3_open16() is used, then flags is &lt;a href=&quot;c3ref/c_open_autoproxy&quot;&gt;SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href=&quot;c3ref/c_open_autoproxy&quot;&gt;SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE&lt;/a&gt;.

But the overlay can be set to cause the Nth memory allocation to fail. To run an OOM test, the overlay is first set to fail on the first allocation attempt. Then some test script is run and verification that the allocation was correctly caught and handled is made. Then the overlay is set to fail on the second allocation and the test repeats. The failure point continues to advance one allocation at a time until the entire test procedure runs to completion without hitting a memory allocation error. This whole test sequence run twice.

          <source>The same thing can be done with an enterprise client/server database, of course. The advantage of SQLite is that it is easier to install and use and the resulting database is a single file that can be written to a USB memory stick or emailed to a colleague.</source>

          <source>The scalar SQL function rtreecheck(R) or rtreecheck(S,R) runs an integrity check on the rtree table named R contained within database S. The function returns a human-language description of any problems found, or the string 'ok' if everything is ok. Running rtreecheck() on an R*Tree virtual table is similar to running &lt;a href=&quot;pragma#pragma_integrity_check&quot;&gt;PRAGMA integrity_check&lt;/a&gt; on a database.</source>

          <source>The scenario above sounds far-fetched. But the SQLite developers are aware of at least one commercial product that was released with exactly this bug. The vendor came to the SQLite developers seeking help in tracking down some infrequent database corruption issues they were seeing on Linux and Mac. The problem was eventually traced to the fact that the application was linking against two separate copies of SQLite. The solution was to change the application build procedures to link against just one copy of SQLite instead of two.</source>
